      <p>
        <b>Quotas and Limits</b><br />
        The Service is intended for development purposes and is not a production
        platform. We operate on shared servers and so we will rapidly suspend
        accounts that generate sustained high levels of load or use provided
        resources in a way that deteriorates the experience for other users.

        <ul class='narrow-list'>
          <li>Disk: 3GB per VM (or what your paid account comes with)</li>
          <li>Ram: 1GB per VM</li>
          <li>Network output: 7GB/week (free accounts), 14GB/week (paid accounts)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      Koding reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts found in
      violation of these items with or without prior notice given and without
      liability.
      <p>
        In addition, Koding reserves the right to terminate unused VMs after a
        period of inactivity (Usually 45-60 days). Inactive accounts will be
        notified before any such action is taken.
