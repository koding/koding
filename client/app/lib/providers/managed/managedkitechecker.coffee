# ManagedKiteChecker is a singleton in ComputeController for listening for
# new managed kites from Kontrol.
#
# ManagedKiteChecker will inform a *single* listener of a new kite at a
# time. New kites are not broadcasted to listeners. The logic behind
# this is that a ManagedKiteChecker listener has ownership of the new
# kite.
#
# If (for some reason) you need to listen for all new kites, kites
# are also emitted via an @emit on 'NewKite', and can be subscribed to
# with @on and @off, as expected. It's worth noting that a listener is
# required for the NewKite event to be emitted, currently.

  ###*
   * @param {Number} options.delay - The delay (in seconds) that the
   *  first tick will be called after. This applies to each listener
   *  currently, and is not offset from actual total waited time. Eg,
   *  if the 5th listener has been waiting for 4 other listeners, it
   *  will wait (at minimum) `options.delay * 5`.
   *
   * @param {Number} options.interval - The interval rate (in seconds)
   *  at which @tick is called.
   *
   * @param {Number} options.maxTicks - The maximum number of ticks
   *  that ManagedKiteChecker will poll Kontrol for a single
   *  listener. The Tick Count is reset for each new current listener.
