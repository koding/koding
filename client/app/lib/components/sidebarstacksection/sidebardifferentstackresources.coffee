  # this is at best a notification, we shouldn't put this on
  # top of the sidebar as a forcing function. if we do, there should be "hide this" option
  # i'd argue that we should remove this completely for now.
  # users should go to stack catalogue, select whatever stack they like.
  # on top of that, we say "go re-init your default stack", re-init means
  # re-init the current one, this action changes the current with the new
  # default thereby it's very confusing.
