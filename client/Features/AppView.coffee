        <h4>Hosted on Amazon</h4>
        <p>Koding VMs are essentially Amazon VMs which means they carry with
        them the dependability that Amazon's cloud infrastructure is known for.
        Your Koding VM will be an Amazon t2.micro instance.</p>

        <h4>Docker</h4>
        <p>Koding VMs are not sliced up hosts running LXC. This means that
        you can easily run advanced technologies like Docker and still keep your file tree clean.
       </p>

        <h4>Ubuntu 14.04</h4>
        <p>Koding VMs run Ubuntu 14.04 and come with
        all the default packages and software that ship with a standard
        Ubuntu image (plus we have added a few more goodies).</p>

        <h4>Multiple language support</h4>
        <p>Go, NodeJS, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, C, C++, Javascript, Coffeescript,
        etc. whatever your language of choice, our IDE supports it and gives you
        gorgeous syntax highlighting.</p>

        <h4>Awesome shortcuts</h4>
        <p>Let that mouse take a rest for a while and unleash your typing super
        powers by using our extensive keyboard shortcuts to control everything
        inside the IDE.</p>

        <h4>Themes</h4>
        <p>Easily switch the default color theme and font to one from a growing
        list of choices. We are sure that you will find a favorite within minutes.</p>

        <h4>Themes</h4>
        <p>Terminal offers multiple color themes and font selections so that
        you can change the default to one that makes it easier for you to
        spend hours on Koding.</p>

        <h4>Chromebook Friendly</h4>
        <p>Linux terminal and Chromebooks...together at last. Terminal runs
        nicely inside your Chromebook giving you the full power of Koding
        on the go.</p>

        <h4>Multi-tab</h4>
        <p>Open as many Terminal tabs as you would like. Each Terminal tab lives
        inside its own independent process. Multitask like there’s no tomorrow!</p>
