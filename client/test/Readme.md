### Running tests in local development environment


To run Nightwatch tests in your local development environment you need to set `startProcess` to `true` in `nightwatch.json` at line 9.

Then you need to go tests folder and run tests.

```
cd tests
./test activity post
```

`./test` takes 2 parameters. First one suite name which is a folder name under `tests/src` folder. Second one is optional. If you donâ€™t pass second parameter all tests in that folder will be run. Second parameter should be file name in that folder. Here is the examples.


- `./test activity` this will run all tests for activity
- `./test activity editdelete` this will just run edit delete tests
- `./test ide` run all tests for IDE
- `./test ide workspace` run workspace related tests for IDE.
