The Simplest Way to Manage Your Entire Dev Infrastructure!

Koding is a development platform that provides a manner for you to build up your
environment from scratch. Developers get everything they need to spin up
full-stack, project-specific environments in seconds. Share them, update them,
and manage infrastructure from a simple interface.

You can try Koding now on [koding.com](https://www.koding.com)

## Quick Start with Docker

Koding can be run as a docker container, it requires `docker-compose` which
you can install from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). For the
rest you can follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koding/docker-compose.git koding-docker-compose
cd koding-docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

Then you will be able to access Koding UI via port `8090` (e.g. [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)) on your host.

## Run Koding on Koding.com

Yes, you can run koding on [koding.com](https://www.koding.com) by using
the provided [.koding.yml](https://github.com/koding/koding/blob/master/.koding.yml)

For more information about stacks: [koding.com/docs](https://www.koding.com/docs/creating-an-aws-stack)

## Getting started for Development

If you wish to work on Koding itself, you need to install following software
packages:

### Software Requirements

- [Golang](http://www.golang.org/) v1.4
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v0.10
- [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)
- [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/)

### Start developing

If you have the above software packages installed on your computer, you can
follow these steps for running an instance of Koding:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/koding/koding.git /your/koding/path
cd /your/koding/path
node -v # make sure your node version is not greater than `0.10.x`
coffee -v # make sure this doesn't return an error
npm install
```

You should have packages ready for running build specific scripts.

```bash
cd /your/koding/path
./configure # create necessary config files
./run install # start to install dependencies
./run buildservices # build the services
./run # run all services
```

As a result of these steps, you will have a file watcher watching your backend files
(both node, and golang) which will restart services when necessary. Now open up
another terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
cd /your/koding/path
cd client # move into frontend client folder
npm install # install client dependencies
make # this will run a client watcher for you
```

Right now you should have 2 different watchers for (1) your backend files, (2)
for your frontend client files.

Now you can navigate to [](http://localhost:8090) to see your local Koding
instance. Enjoy!

You can follow [coffeescript-styleguide](https://github.com/koding/styleguide-coffeescript)
that we are relying on.
