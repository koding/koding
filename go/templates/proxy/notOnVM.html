        Koding servers are provided for active development only. This means
        that they are not suitable for hosting blogs or production sites. To
        maintain a great experience for everyone, Koding will put inactive
        servers to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. This prevents
        malicious and abusive users from utilizing Koding, allowing you to have
        faster and more stable servers.

        If this is your server, please log into Koding to activate it again.
