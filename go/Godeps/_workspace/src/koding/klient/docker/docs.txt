1. Docker Deamon needs to be run in TCP Mode. If UNIX sockets are used we
need to setup the client so it has access to the `docker` group which
maintains the the socket. So initiallty TCP is a good start.
2. TCP mode is enabled by adding "-H tcp://bind-ip:port" to
/etc/default/docker or DOCKER_OPTS
3. But only authenticated Client should access it over TCP, so we need to
generate TLS cert keys and let both the Deamon and Client use it.
4. The boot2docker guys are using this package:
https://github.com/SvenDowideit/generate_cert for it which we can also use.
5. Here is also some information on how to start the Docker Deamon securely

-------------------------------
# Install latest docker to Ubuntu
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ubuntu/ | sudo sh

-------------------------------

We can use the UNIX socket but then we need to add the user to this group.
http://askubuntu.com/questions/477551/how-can-i-use-docker-without-sudo

sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a arslan docker
sudo service docker restart
newgrp docker # but the user should login/logout


-------------------------------

After creating a new Docker struct, it'll be able to manage
// Docker containers. A usual working lifecyle is:
// 1. Build a Docker image
// 2. Create a new Docker container from that image
// 3. Start this container
// 4. Connect and open a terminal instance to it (optional)
// 5. Stop the container
// 6. Remove the container
// 7. Destroy the image
