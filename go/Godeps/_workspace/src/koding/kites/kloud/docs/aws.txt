# Setup a AWS region/account to be used with Kloud

Go to AWS VPC Console and do the followings:

1. Go to VPC console. Create VPC's with CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16. Add for each VPC a
new tag with Key: "Kloud" and Value: "kloud-vpc-{number}" An example set of
VPC's:

* Koding User Machines 1 vpc-23d63c46 available 10.0.0.0/16 dopt-ea120188 rtb-ba10e3df acl-515fa934 Default No
* Koding User Machines 2 vpc-2fd63c4a available 10.0.0.0/16 dopt-ea120188 rtb-8010e3e5 acl-5c5fa939 Default No
* Koding User Machines 3 vpc-3fd63c5a available 10.0.0.0/16 dopt-ea120188 rtb-9f10e3fa acl-2e5fa94b Default No

2. Create Subnets with CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 and different availabilty Zone for
each one. Each subnet should use only one VPC. So according to the VPC's above
we need to have only three subnets with the maximum possible IP counts. Enable
Auto-Assign Public Ip for each subnet.  Add for each VPC a new tag with Key:
"Kloud" and Value: "kloud-subnet-{number}"

* Koding User Subnet 1 subnet-d38645b6 available vpc-23d63c46 (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 1 10.0.0.0/16 65531 ap-southeast-1a rtb-ba10e3df acl-515fa934 No Yes
* Koding User Subnet 3 subnet-bb8645de available vpc-3fd63c5a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 3 10.0.0.0/16 65531 ap-southeast-1a rtb-9f10e3fa acl-2e5fa94b No Yes
* Koding User Subnet 2 subnet-8c7a9dfb available vpc-2fd63c4a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 2 10.0.0.0/16 65531 ap-southeast-1b rtb-8010e3e5 acl-5c5fa939 No Yes

Also delete and left only on Default subnet. Tag it with the name "Default"

3. Create Internet Gateways with the names "Koding User {number}" and attach
each gateway to one VPC from the list above:

* Koding User 1 igw-49fe1a2c attached vpc-23d63c46 (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 1
* Koding User 2 igw-48fe1a2d attached vpc-2fd63c4a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 2
* Koding User 3 igw-5dfe1a38 attached vpc-3fd63c5a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 3

4. Go to "Route Tables" to include the created Internet gateways. Click on one
Route Table and from the "Routes" section add a new Destionation with
"0.0.0.0/0" to Target which is the internet gateway. It will be come up
automatically. Go again to Subnet section and check for each Subnet's
RouteTable if it's now including the internet gateway.

5. Go back to EC2 console. Create Security Group for each VPC with Name "Koding
User {number}" and new tag with key "Kloud" with Value: "kloud-sg-1". Each
security group should be assigned to only one VPC. Each SG should have inbound
and outbound with 0.0.0.0/0 to all traffic:

* Koding User 1 sg-75b47410 kloud-user-1 vpc-23d63c46 (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 1 Koding User Machines 1
* Koding User 2 sg-24b47441 kloud-user-2 vpc-2fd63c4a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 2 Koding User Machines 2
* Koding User 3 sg-29b4744c kloud-user-3 vpc-3fd63c5a (10.0.0.0/16) | Koding User Machines 3 Koding User Machines 3
 
Go to AWS EC2 Console and do the followings:

6. Add kloud-deployment key pair. Click on "Import Key Pair" under the section
"Key Pairs" in EC2 Console. Name it as "kloud-deployment" and following
content:

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDYFQFq/DEN0B2YbiZqb3jr+iQphLrzW6svvBjQLUXiKA0P0NfgedvNbqqr2WQcQDKqdZQSHJPccfYYvjyy0wEwD7hq8BDkHTv83nMNxJb3hdmo/ibZmGoUBkw3K7E8fzaWzUDDNSlzBk3UrGayaaLxzOw1LhO5XUfesKNWCg4HzdzjjOklNpJ61iQP4u8JRqXJaOV5RPogHYFDlGXPOaBuDxvOZZanEgaKsfFkwEvpU0km5001XVf8spM7o8f2iEalG9CMF1UVk38/BKBngxSLRyYdP/K0ZdRBSq1syKs8/KPrDWQ6eyqG2cW6Zrb8wb2IDg7Na+PfnUlQn9S+jmF9 hello@koding.com

The Fingerprint should be: d1:2a:50:1a:bc:29:f4:0f:df:04:70:27:3d:79:eb:66 , be sure it's the same

7. Checkout if AMI is availabile in you region. If no go to "koding base"
account and do a "Copy AMI" and copy the "Base-Koding-3gb" to the desired
region. After copying be sure you "shared" the AMI with the `koding-vms`
account. So you should give "permission" to the koding-vms by adding the
koding-vms account id to the permission list of that particulat AMI. The
current koding-vms account id is "614068383889"

8. Create a new "Koding" ami from that particular new AMI in that region with
Packer and label it as "koding-stable". For that create an additional
`koding-{region}.json` packer file. Just copy from a pre existing file and
modify it. Change the JSON fields "region" and "source_ami". Rest should be the
same. Write region down as it's in the dashboard. For the "source_ami", copy
the AMI that you shared with this region in step 7. It is different for each
region. Copy the AMI ID that has "Base-koding-3gb" or a description saying
"Copied from ..."

Create it with the packer command:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY=""  AWS_SECRET_KEY="" packer build koding-ireland.json

The access and secret key should be a valid within the "koding-vms" account.
