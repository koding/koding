**WELCOME TO KODING!**
You've said goodbye to your localhost and are ready to develop software in the cloud!

**Why Koding?**
Koding is a cloud-based development platform that allows you to:
- Focus on learning and writing software without the need to setup stuff.
- Collaborate with others in real-time and pair-program.
- Learn through interaction with a community of like-minded developers.
- Have a question? Post it on the #public channel and engage with our 
  global developer community!

Koding VMs, the little green box(es) on the sidebar, run Ubuntu Linux (14.04) and are
fully functional development machines (just like your own computer). You can write code 
in any programming language that is supported by Ubuntu/Linux. 

Ruby, perl, gcc, python, php, go, node, etc. are all preinstalled on your VM! You can 
start writing code right away without the need for new installs! If something is not
installed, getting it installed is as easy as 1-2-3.

**Some handy links and pointers to get your inital questions answered**
1. Getting started with our IDE and Terminal:

2. How to write your first "hello world" program. We have examples for PHP, Python, Perl,
   Ruby, C, etc. Great to get you going!

3. If you want to install more software, take a look at Koding Package Manager (kpm). It 
   can make life much easier when it comes to installing new stuff.

4. To run a command as the `root` user, prefix any command with `sudo <command>`. But 
   remember, with great power, comes great responsibility! :-)

5. By default, your sudo password is blank. Most people like it that way but if you prefer,
   you can use the `sudo passwd` command and change the default (blank) password to 
   something more secure. This is completely optional.
