WELCOME TO THE 2016 HACK.SUMMIT() VIRTUAL HACKATHON
(Presented by Pluralsight and powered by Koding & IBM Cloud SoftLayer)

Are you ready for an awesome weekend of hacking? We are super duper excited to
share this weekend (virtually) with you as you hack on  your amazing projects.
This doc will serve as your “guide” as you compete in this one of a kind event.
Good luck!

For the hackathon, a special always-on VM has been added to your account. You
should see it in the sidebar with the name “softlayer-vm-x”.
This is a 1GB, 1CPU, 25GB disk VM brought to you by IBM Cloud SoftLayer.

SCHEDULE:

1. You can only start writing code beginning of Saturday the 20th (00:01 hour PST).
   ALL CODE MUST BE WRITTEN DURING THE 48 HOURS OF THE EVENT.
2. The hackathon starts at 00:01 PST on the 20th of Feb (Saturday).
3. The hackathon ends at 23:59 PST on the 21st of Feb (Sunday)
4. If you are in a different timezone than PST, please make the appropriate
   calculations to know your own start and stop time.
   Use http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/ or http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html
   to do the timezone math.

RULES

Please familiarize yourself with these rules as we will enforce them vigorously.

1. If you are reading this, then you are free to start preparing your team’s
   project environment on the “softlayer-xx” VM in your account.
   This new “hackathon VM” should appear on your Koding account as shown here:
   http://take.ms/adnog
   The final project should be hosted on this VM. (Note, prepare means install any
   required programs and not write actual code.)
2. If such a VM does not exist in your account, then that means you did not
   give us a valid Koding username for yourself or your team members. If this
   is the case and no one on your team has the hackathon VM, please contact us
   immediately (see below for how to get support).
3. Even if multiple team members on your team have the softlayer-vm-x added to
   their account, you only need to submit your project on one of these available VMs.
4. Your project must be a web app (mobile apps are not acceptable) that is
   viewable on the softlayer-xx VM’s public web URL. Each of these special
   hackathon VM’s have a public IP that is viewable by using the Terminal
   command: curl ifconfig.co
5. You can make changes to your team members up until the time you submit the
   final project. The final project submission form will have a place for you
   to list all the team members.
6. Your project must fall under one of the themes of the event.
7. You’re free to use any programming language, open source frameworks/library
   that you want.
8. You can use any public API or resource.
9. You must host the code for your project on GitHub as a public repo. We will
   ask for that repo’s URL as part of the submission process. (Your code
   belongs to you, but we need to access it.)
10. You should also read the rules.

HALP! I AM STUCK! HOW DO I GET SUPPORT?

If you have a support request relating to Koding (your VM account, etc.) then
please email hackathon@koding.com. For support regarding software installs,
how-to’s, etc. you should visit the #codementor channel on Koding (URL below)
https://koding.com/Activity/Topic/codementor

The Codementor team is on standby to answer your general questions related to
programming languages, packages, runtime issues, etc.

HOW DO I SUBMIT MY PROJECT?

Once you are done with your hackathon project, please use this URL to submit
your work. Remember, your project should be in running  and accessible to the
public via a web browser.

Oh, and we expect you to make a lot of noise on twitter while you are hacking.
We’ll be watching for the most creative tweets that mention @koding and #hackathon :)

Good luck and Kode on!

PS: if you read all the way till here, you are awesome!
