Most of this project is auto-generated.

The notable directories which are not auto-generated:

   google-api-go-generator/ -- the generator itself
   google-api/              -- shared common code, used by auto-generated code
   examples/                -- sample code

When changing the generator, re-compile all APIs and submit the
modified APIs in the same CL as the generator changes itself.
