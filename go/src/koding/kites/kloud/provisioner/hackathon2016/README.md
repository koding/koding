WELCOME TO THE 2016 HACK.SUMMIT() VIRTUAL HACKATHON!
[Presented by Pluralsight and powered by Koding & IBM Cloud]

Are you ready for an awesome weekend of hacking? We are super duper
excited to share this weekend (virtually) with you as you hack on
your amazing projects.

This document will serve as your “guide” as you compete in this event.
Please read it as there's a ton of great info in here.

Good luck!

====
A free, always-on VM has been added to your account. You are reading
this file on that special VM. The specs of this VM are: 
1GB RAM, 1 Core CPU, 25GB Disk

This special VM is brought to you by IBM Cloud running on SoftLayer.
Your final project MUST be hosted on this VM. This is a requirement.

THE SCHEDULE
1. The hackathon starts at 00:01 PST on the 20th of Feb (Saturday).
2. The hackathon ends at 23:59 PST on the 21st of Feb (Sunday).
   :--ALL CODE MUST BE WRITTEN DURING THE 48 HOURS OF THE EVENT--:
   We will monitor the file systems of the VMs to enforce this.
3. If you are in a different timezone than PST, use the websites
   listed below to make the appropriate calculations to know your
   relative start and stop time.
   - http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/
   - http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html
   We expect that you will honor the spirit of this global, virtual 
   event and adhere to the required start/end times.

THE RULES
Please familiarize yourself with these rules as we will enforce them 
vigorously.
1. If you are reading this, then you are free to start preparing your 
   team’s project environment on the “softlayer-xx” VM in your account.
   (Note, "prepare" means you can install any required servers/frameworks
   and NOT write actual code.)
2. The final project MUST be hosted on the "softlayer-vm-xx" VM that we
   have added to your account... no exceptions. e.g. your project URL can
   be http://159.8.66.189/my_start_page (159.8.66.189 is an example ip address)
   You can get the IP address of your VM by using the command:
   curl ifconfig.co
   Do not use domain names, use only the IP address when you submit the project.
3. Even if multiple team members on your team have the softlayer-vm-xx VM
   added to their account, you only need to submit your project on one 
   of these VMs.
4. Your project must be a web app (mobile apps are not acceptable) that is
   accessible from the url that you provide. Each of these hackathon VM’s
   have a public IP address.
5. You can make changes to your team members up until the time you submit 
   the final project. The final project submission form will have a place 
   for you to list all the team members.
6. Your project MUST fall under one of the themes of the event.
7. You’re free to use any programming language, open source frameworks/library
   that you want and any public API or resource.
8. You MUST host the code for your project on GitHub as a public repo. 
   We will ask for that repo’s URL as part of the submission process. 
   (Your code belongs to you, but we need to access it.)
9. If anyone is found "bending" the rules, then they, along with their team, 
   will be automatically disqualified.

HALP! I AM STUCK... HOW DO I GET SUPPORT?
If you have a support request relating to Koding (your VM, account, etc.) then
please email hackathon@koding.com. For support regarding software installs,
how-to’s, etc. you should visit the #codementor channel on Koding (URL below)
https://koding.com/Activity/Topic/codementor
The Codementor.com team is on standby to answer your general questions
related to programming languages, packages, runtime issues, etc.
(Note: This channel will only be accessible once you are logged into your
Koding account.)

HOW DO I SUBMIT MY PROJECT?
Once you are done with your hackathon project, please use the URL below to
submit your work. All submissions MUST be received by 23:59 PST on the 21st
of February. There are no exceptions to this. We recommend that you start 
the submission process 30-45 minutes before the deadline as several people
will be trying to submit at the same time and that can lead to delays.

Remember, your project should be in running  and accessible to the public
via a web browser. We will not be starting any servers or services on your
VM in order to evaluate your work. We will simply hit the URL you
provide us in order to view your work.

We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the submission form now 
in order to get the required info ready so that you don't have to scramble
at the last minute!

MAKE NOISE!
Oh, and we expect you to make a lot of noise on Twitter while you are hacking.
Make us a part of your experience. Share pictures of your team hacking or vines
of your team devouring code! We’ll be watching for the most creative tweets
that mention @koding and #hackathon  :)

Good luck and Kode on!
