// Gophercloud provides a multi-vendor interface to OpenStack-compatible clouds which attempts to follow
// established Go community coding standards and social norms.
//
// Unless you intend on contributing code to the SDK, you will almost certainly never have to use any
// Context structures or any of its methods.  Contextual methods exist for easier unit testing only.
// Stick with the global functions unless you know exactly what you're doing, and why.
