# go-rundeck-api

This is a Go client for the Rundeck HTTP API. It was primarily developed to back the Rundeck provider in [Terraform](https://terraform.io), but can be used standalone too.

It should ``go install`` just like any other Go package:

* ``go install github.com/apparentlymart/go-rundeck-api/rundeck``

For reference documentation, see [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/apparentlymart/go-rundeck-api/rundeck).
