# aws\_eip

Provides an Elastic IP resource.

## Example Usage

```
resource "aws_eip" "lb" {
    instance = "${aws_instance.web.id}"
    vpc = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vpc` - (Optional) Boolean if the EIP is in a VPC or not.
* `instance` - (Optional) EC2 instance ID.
* `network_interface` - (Optional) Network interface ID to associate with.

~> **NOTE:** You can specify either the `instance` ID or the `network_interface` ID,
but not both. Including both will **not** return an error from the AWS API, but will
have undefined behavior. See the relevant [AssociateAddress API Call][1] for
more information.

* `id` - Contains the EIP allocation ID.
* `private_ip` - Contains the private IP address (if in VPC).
