# Command: apply

The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes required
to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined
set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform apply [options] [dir-or-plan]`

By default, `apply` scans the current directory for the configuration
and applies the changes appropriately. However, a path to another configuration
or an execution plan can be provided. Execution plans can be used to only
execute a pre-determined set of actions.

The `dir` argument can also be a [module source](/docs/modules/index.html).
In this case, `apply` behaves as though `init` were called with that
argument followed by an `apply` in the current directory. This is meant
as a shortcut for getting started.

The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:

* `-backup=path` - Path to the backup file. Defaults to `-state-out` with
  the ".backup" extension. Disabled by setting to "-".

* `-input=true` - Ask for input for variables if not directly set.

* `-no-color` - Disables output with coloring.

* `-refresh=true` - Update the state for each resource prior to planning
  and applying. This has no effect if a plan file is given directly to
  apply.

* `-state=path` - Path to the state file. Defaults to "terraform.tfstate".

* `-state-out=path` - Path to write updated state file. By default, the
  `-state` path will be used.

* `-target=resource` - A [Resource
  Address](/docs/internals/resource-addressing.html) to target. Operation will
  be limited to this resource and its dependencies. This flag can be used
  multiple times.

* `-var 'foo=bar'` - Set a variable in the Terraform configuration. This
  flag can be set multiple times.

* `-var-file=foo` - Set variables in the Terraform configuration from
   a file. If "terraform.tfvars" is present, it will be automatically
   loaded first. Any files specified by `-var-file` override any values
   in a "terraform.tfvars".
