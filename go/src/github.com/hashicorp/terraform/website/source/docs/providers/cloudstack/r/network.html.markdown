resource "cloudstack_network" "default" {

    network_offering = "Default Network"
    zone = "zone-1"
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the network.

    required by the Network Offering if specifyVlan=true is set. Only the ROOT 
    admin can set this value.

    this forces a new resource to be created.

* `aclid` - (Optional) The ID of a network ACL that should be attached to the
    network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `project` - (Optional) The name or ID of the project to deploy this
    instance to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
