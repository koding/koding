## Example Usage

```
# Create a new Datadog monitor
resource "datadog_monitor" "foo" {
  name = "Name for monitor foo"
  type = "metric alert"
  message = "Monitor triggered. Notify: @hipchat-channel"
  escalation_message = "Escalation message @pagerduty"

  query = "avg(last_1h):avg:aws.ec2.cpu{environment:foo,host:foo} by {host} > 2"

  thresholds {
	ok = 0
	warning = 1
	critical = 2
  }

  notify_no_data = false
  renotify_interval = 60

  notify_audit = false
  timeout_h = 60
  include_tags = true
  silenced {
    "*" = 0
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `type` - (Required) The type of the monitor, chosen from:
    * `metric alert`
    * `service check`
    * `event alert`
    * `query alert`
* `name` - (Required) Name of Datadog monitor
* `query` - (Required) The monitor query to notify on with syntax varying depending on what type of monitor
    you are creating. See [API Reference](http://docs.datadoghq.com/api) for options.
* `message` - (Required) A message to include with notifications for this monitor.
    Email notifications can be sent to specific users by using the same '@username' notation as events.
* `escalation_message` - (Optional) A message to include with a re-notification. Supports the '@username'
    notification allowed elsewhere.
* `thresholds` - (Required) Thresholds by threshold type:
    * `ok`
    * `warning`
    * `critical`
* `notify_no_data` (Optional) A boolean indicating whether this monitor will notify when data stops reporting. Defaults
    to false.
* `no_data_timeframe` (Optional) The number of minutes before a monitor will notify when data stops reporting. Must be at
    least 2x the monitor timeframe for metric alerts or 2 minutes for service checks. Default: 2x timeframe for
    metric alerts, 2 minutes for service checks.
* `renotify_interval` (Optional) The number of minutes after the last notification before a monitor will re-notify
    on the current status. It will only re-notify if it's not resolved.
* `notify_audit` (Optional) A boolean indicating whether tagged users will be notified on changes to this monitor. 
    Defaults to false.
* `timeout_h` (Optional) The number of hours of the monitor not reporting data before it will automatically resolve
    from a triggered state. Defaults to false.
* `include_tags` (Optional) A boolean indicating whether notifications from this monitor will automatically insert its
    triggering tags into the title. Defaults to true.
* `silenced` (Optional) Each scope will be muted until the given POSIX timestamp or forever if the value is 0.
    
    To mute the alert completely:
    
        silenced {
          '*' =  0
        }
          
    To mute role:db for a short time:
    
        silenced {
          'role:db' = 1412798116
        }

## Attributes Reference
