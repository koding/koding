# openstack\_compute\_secgroup_v2

Manages a V2 security group resource within OpenStack.

## Example Usage

```
resource "openstack_compute_secgroup_v2" "secgroup_1" {
  name = "my_secgroup"
  description = "my security group"
  rule {
    from_port = 22
    to_port = 22
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    cidr = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
  rule {
    from_port = 80
    to_port = 80
    ip_protocol = "tcp"
    cidr = "0.0.0.0/0"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Required) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client.
    A Compute client is needed to create a security group. If omitted, the
    `OS_REGION_NAME` environment variable is used. Changing this creates a new
    security group.

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the security group. Changing this
    updates the `name` of an existing security group.

* `description` - (Required) A description for the security group. Changing this
    updates the `description` of an existing security group.

* `rule` - (Optional) A rule describing how the security group operates. The
    rule object structure is documented below. Changing this updates the
    security group rules. As shown in the example above, multiple rule blocks
    may be used.

The `rule` block supports:

* `from_port` - (Required) An integer representing the lower bound of the port
range to open. Changing this creates a new security group rule.

* `to_port` - (Required) An integer representing the upper bound of the port
range to open. Changing this creates a new security group rule.

* `ip_protocol` - (Required) The protocol type that will be allowed. Changing
this creates a new security group rule.

* `cidr` - (Optional) Required if `from_group_id` is empty. The IP range that
will be the source of network traffic to the security group. Use 0.0.0.0./0
to allow all IP addresses. Changing this creates a new security group rule.

* `from_group_id` - (Optional) Required if `cidr` is empty. The ID of a group
from which to forward traffic to the parent group. Changing
this creates a new security group rule.

* `self` - (Optional) Required if `cidr` and `from_group_id` is empty. If true,
the security group itself will be added as a source to this ingress rule.
