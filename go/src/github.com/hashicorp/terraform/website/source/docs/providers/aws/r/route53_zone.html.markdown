# aws\_route53\_zone

Provides a Route53 Hosted Zone resource.

## Example Usage

```
resource "aws_route53_zone" "primary" {
   name = "example.com"
}
```

For use in subdomains, note that you need to create a
`aws_route53_record` of type `NS` as well as the subdomain
zone.

```
resource "aws_route53_zone" "main" {
  name = "example.com"
}

resource "aws_route53_zone" "dev" {
  name = "dev.example.com"

  tags {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "dev-ns" {
    zone_id = "${aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id}"
    name = "dev.example.com"
    type = "NS"
    ttl = "30"
    records = [
        "${aws_route53_zone.dev.name_servers.0}",
        "${aws_route53_zone.dev.name_servers.1}",
        "${aws_route53_zone.dev.name_servers.2}",
        "${aws_route53_zone.dev.name_servers.3}"
    ]
}
```
