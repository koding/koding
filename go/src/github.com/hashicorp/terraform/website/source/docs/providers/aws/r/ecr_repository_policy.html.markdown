# aws\_ecr\_repository\_policy

Provides an ECR repository policy.

Note that currently only one policy may be applied to a repository.

~> **NOTE on ECR Availability**: The EC2 Container Registry has an [initial
launch region of
`us-east-1`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-container-registry-now-generally-available/).
As more regions become available, they will be listed [in the AWS
Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ecr_region)
