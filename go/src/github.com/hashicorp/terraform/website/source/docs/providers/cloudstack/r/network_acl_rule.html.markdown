  aclid = "f3843ce0-334c-4586-bbd3-0c2e2bc946c6"

  rule {
    action = "allow"
    cidr_list = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports = ["80", "1000-2000"]
    traffic_type = "ingress"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `aclid` - (Required) The network ACL ID for which to create the rules.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `managed` - (Optional) USE WITH CAUTION! If enabled all the firewall rules for
    this network ACL will be managed by this resource. This means it will delete
    all firewall rules that are not in your config! (defaults false)

* `rule` - (Optional) Can be specified multiple times. Each rule block supports
    fields documented below. If `managed = false` at least one rule is required!

    concurrently. (defaults 2)

    given ports. This attribute is deprecated, please use `cidr_list` instead.

* `protocol` - (Required) The name of the protocol to allow. Valid options are:
    `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `all` or a valid protocol number.
