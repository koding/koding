== About ==

The Sets package provides implementations of hash-based Sets for all of Go's basic types. Currently there's no documentation but the extensive test suite Includes numerous examples of how to use slices to solve common tasks.

The package has its origins in research for the GoLightly virtual machine project. I hope you will find it useful.
