# RFCs

This is a place to hold proposals and design discussions for components of the
Go kit.

Let's keep the process lightweight. To propose a new RFC, make a pull request
with a new file, roughly in the same format as the others. To make changes to
an existing RFC, make a pull request with your changes, and describe your
motivation in the comments.

RFCs follow the [Chef RFC workflow](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md#rfc-review-and-workflow).

At this stage of the project, RFC ratification will be done by me (Peter
Bourgon). Once we reach a usable MVP, i.e. semantic version 1.0.0, I hope we'll
transition to a more community-driven governance model.

For questions and free-form discussion, please use IRC or the mailing list.
