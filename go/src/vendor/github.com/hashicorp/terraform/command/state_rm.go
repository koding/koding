Usage: terraform state rm [options] ADDRESS...

  Remove one or more items from the Terraform state.

  This command removes one or more items from the Terraform state based
  on the address given. You can view and list the available resources
  with "terraform state list".

  This command creates a timestamped backup of the state on every invocation.
  This can't be disabled. Due to the destructive nature of this command,
  the backup is ensured by Terraform for safety reasons.

Options:

  -backup=PATH        Path where Terraform should write the backup
                      state. This can't be disabled. If not set, Terraform
                      will write it to the same path as the statefile with
                      a backup extension. This backup will be made in addition
                      to the timestamped backup.

  -state=statefile    Path to a Terraform state file to use to look
                      up Terraform-managed resources. By default it will
                      use the state "terraform.tfstate" if it exists.
