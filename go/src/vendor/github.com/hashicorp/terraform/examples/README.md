# Terraform Examples

This folder contains a set of Terraform examples. These examples each
have their own README you can read for more details on what the example
does.

To run any example, just run `terraform apply` within that directory
if you have Terraform checked out. Or, you can run it directly from git:

```
$ terraform init github.com/hashicorp/terraform/examples/aws-two-tier
...

$ terraform apply
...
```
