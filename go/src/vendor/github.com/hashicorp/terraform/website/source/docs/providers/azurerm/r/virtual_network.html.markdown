# azurerm\_virtual\_network

Creates a new virtual network including any configured subnets. Each subnet can
optionally be configured with a security group to be associated with the subnet.

## Example Usage

```
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {
  name                = "virtualNetwork1"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "West US"

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet1"
    address_prefix = "10.0.1.0/24"
  }

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet2"
    address_prefix = "10.0.2.0/24"
  }

  subnet {
    name           = "subnet3"
    address_prefix = "10.0.3.0/24"
  }
  
  tags {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the virtual network. Changing this forces a
    new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
    create the virtual network.

* `address_space` - (Required) The address space that is used the virtual
    network. You can supply more than one address space. Changing this forces
    a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the virtual network is
    created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `dns_servers` - (Optional) List of names of DNS servers previously registered
    on Azure.

* `subnet` - (Optional) Can be specified multiple times to define multiple
    subnets. Each `subnet` block supports fields documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. 

The `subnet` block supports:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the subnet.

* `address_prefix` - (Required) The address prefix to use for the subnet.

* `security_group` - (Optional) The Network Security Group to associate with
    the subnet.

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The virtual NetworkConfiguration ID.
