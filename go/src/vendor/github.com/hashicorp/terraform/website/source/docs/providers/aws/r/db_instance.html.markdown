# aws\_db\_instance

Provides an RDS instance resource.  A DB instance is an isolated database
environment in the cloud.  A DB instance can contain multiple user-created
databases.

Changes to a DB instance can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as `allocated_storage`, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
`apply_immediately` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

When upgrading the major version of an engine, `allow_major_version_upgrade` must be set to `true`

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on [RDS Maintenance][2]
for more information.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  allocated_storage    = 10
  storage_type         = "gp2"
  engine               = "mysql"
  engine_version       = "5.6.17"
  instance_class       = "db.t1.micro"
  name                 = "mydb"
  username             = "foo"
  password             = "bar"
  db_subnet_group_name = "my_database_subnet_group"
  parameter_group_name = "default.mysql5.6"
}
```

## Argument Reference

For more detailed documentation about each argument, refer to
the [AWS official documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html).

The following arguments are supported:

* `allocated_storage` - (Required unless a `snapshot_identifier` or `replicate_source_db` is provided) The allocated storage in gigabytes.
* `engine` - (Required unless a `snapshot_identifier` or `replicate_source_db` is provided) The database engine to use.
* `engine_version` - (Optional) The engine version to use.
* `identifier` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The name of the RDS instance, if omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique identifier.
* `identifier_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique identifier beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `identifer`.
* `instance_class` - (Required) The instance type of the RDS instance.
* `storage_type` - (Optional) One of "standard" (magnetic), "gp2" (general
    purpose SSD), or "io1" (provisioned IOPS SSD). The default is "io1" if
    `iops` is specified, "standard" if not. Note that this behaviour is different from the AWS web console, where the default is "gp2".
* `final_snapshot_identifier` - (Optional) The name of your final DB snapshot
    when this DB instance is deleted. If omitted, no final snapshot will be
    made.
* `skip_final_snapshot` - (Optional) Determines whether a final DB snapshot is created before the DB instance is deleted. If true is specified, no DBSnapshot is created. If false is specified, a DB snapshot is created before the DB instance is deleted, using the value from `final_snapshot_identifier`. Default is `false`.
* `copy_tags_to_snapshot` â€“ (Optional, boolean) On delete, copy all Instance `tags` to
the final snapshot (if `final_snapshot_identifier` is specified). Default
`false`
* `name` - (Optional) The DB name to create. If omitted, no database is created
    initially.
* `password` - (Required unless a `snapshot_identifier` or `replicate_source_db` is provided) Password for the master DB user. Note that this may
    show up in logs, and it will be stored in the state file.
* `username` - (Required unless a `snapshot_identifier` or `replicate_source_db` is provided) Username for the master DB user.
* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The AZ for the RDS instance.
* `backup_retention_period` - (Optional) The days to retain backups for. Must be
`1` or greater to be a source for a [Read Replica][1].
* `backup_window` - (Optional) The daily time range (in UTC) during which automated backups are created if they are enabled. Example: "09:46-10:16". Must not overlap with `maintenance_window`.
* `iops` - (Optional) The amount of provisioned IOPS. Setting this implies a
    storage_type of "io1".
* `maintenance_window` - (Optional) The window to perform maintenance in.
  Syntax: "ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi". Eg: "Mon:00:00-Mon:03:00".
  See [RDS Maintenance Window docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow) for more.
* `multi_az` - (Optional) Specifies if the RDS instance is multi-AZ
* `port` - (Optional) The port on which the DB accepts connections.
* `publicly_accessible` - (Optional) Bool to control if instance is publicly accessible. Defaults to `false`.
* `vpc_security_group_ids` - (Optional) List of VPC security groups to associate.
* `security_group_names` - (Optional/Deprecated) List of DB Security Groups to associate.
    Only used for [DB Instances on the _EC2-Classic_ Platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html#USER_VPC.FindDefaultVPC).
* `db_subnet_group_name` - (Optional) Name of DB subnet group. DB instance will be created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If unspecified, will be created in the `default` VPC, or in EC2 Classic, if available.
* `parameter_group_name` - (Optional) Name of the DB parameter group to associate.
* `option_group_name` - (Optional) Name of the DB option group to associate.
* `storage_encrypted` - (Optional) Specifies whether the DB instance is encrypted. The default is `false` if not specified.
* `apply_immediately` - (Optional) Specifies whether any database modifications
     are applied immediately, or during the next maintenance window. Default is
     `false`. See [Amazon RDS Documentation for more information.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html)
* `replicate_source_db` - (Optional) Specifies that this resource is a Replicate
database, and to use this value as the source database. This correlates to the
`identifier` of another Amazon RDS Database to replicate. See
[DB Instance Replication][1] and
[Working with PostgreSQL and MySQL Read Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) for
 more information on using Replication.
* `snapshot_identifier` - (Optional) Specifies whether or not to create this database from a snapshot. This correlates to the snapshot ID you'd find in the RDS console, e.g: rds:production-2015-06-26-06-05.

* `monitoring_role_arn` - (Optional) The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send
enhanced monitoring metrics to CloudWatch Logs. You can find more information on the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.html)

* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The ARN for the KMS encryption key.
* `character_set_name` - (Optional) The character set name to use for DB encoding in Oracle instances. This can't be changed.
[Oracle Character Sets Supported in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.OracleCharacterSets.html)
* `iam_database_authentication_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether or mappings of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.
* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
* `timezone` - (Optional) Time zone of the DB instance. `timezone` is currently only supported by Microsoft SQL Server.
The `timezone` can only be set on creation. See [MSSQL User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone) for more information

~> **NOTE:** Removing the `replicate_source_db` attribute from an existing RDS
Replicate database managed by Terraform will promote the database to a fully
standalone database.
