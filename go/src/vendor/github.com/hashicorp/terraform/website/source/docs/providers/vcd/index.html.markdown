# VMware vCloud Director Provider

The VMware vCloud Director provider is used to interact with the resources supported by VMware vCloud Director. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

~> **NOTE:** The VMware vCloud Director Provider currently represents _initial support_ and therefore may undergo significant changes as the community improves it.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the VMware vCloud Director Provider
provider "vcd" {
  user                 = "${var.vcd_user}"
  password             = "${var.vcd_pass}"
  org                  = "${var.vcd_org}"
  url                  = "${var.vcd_url}"
  vdc                  = "${var.vcd_vdc}"
  maxRetryTimeout      = "${var.vcd_maxRetryTimeout}"
  allow_unverified_ssl = "${var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl}"
}

# Create a new network
resource "vcd_network" "net" {
  # ...
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are used to configure the VMware vCloud Director Provider:

* `user` - (Required) This is the username for vCloud Director API operations. Can also
  be specified with the `VCD_USER` environment variable.
* `password` - (Required) This is the password for vCloud Director API operations. Can
  also be specified with the `VCD_PASSWORD` environment variable.
* `org` - (Required) This is the vCloud Director Org on which to run API
  operations. Can also be specified with the `VCD_ORG` environment
  variable.
* `url` - (Required) This is the URL for the vCloud Director API endpoint. e.g.
  https://server.domain.com/api. Can also be specified with the `VCD_URL` environment variable.
* `vdc` - (Optional) This is the virtual datacenter within vCloud Director to run
  API operations against. If not set the plugin will select the first virtual
  datacenter available to your Org. Can also be specified with the `VCD_VDC` environment
  variable.
* `maxRetryTimeout` - (Optional) This provides you with the ability to specify the maximum
  amount of time (in seconds) you are prepared to wait for interactions on resources managed
  by vCloud Director to be successful. If a resource action fails, the action will be retried
  (as long as it is still within the `maxRetryTimeout` value) to try and ensure success.
  Defaults to 60 seconds if not set.
  Can also be specified with the `VCD_MAX_RETRY_TIMEOUT` environment variable.
* `allow_unverified_ssl` - (Optional) Boolean that can be set to true to
  disable SSL certificate verification. This should be used with care as it
  could allow an attacker to intercept your auth token. If omitted, default
  value is false. Can also be specified with the
  `VCD_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL` environment variable.
