# aws\_elasticache\_cluster

Provides an ElastiCache Cluster resource.

Changes to a Cache Cluster can occur when you manually change a
parameter, such as `node_type`, and are reflected in the next maintenance
window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning
phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the
`apply_immediately` flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately
(see documentation below).

~> **Note:** using `apply_immediately` can result in a
brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on
[Modifying an ElastiCache Cache Cluster][2] for more information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_elasticache_cluster" "bar" {
  cluster_id           = "cluster-example"
  engine               = "memcached"
  node_type            = "cache.t2.micro"
  port                 = 11211
  num_cache_nodes      = 1
  parameter_group_name = "default.memcached1.4"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cluster_id` – (Required) Group identifier. ElastiCache converts
  this name to lowercase

* `engine` – (Required) Name of the cache engine to be used for this cache cluster.
 Valid values for this parameter are `memcached` or `redis`

* `engine_version` – (Optional) Version number of the cache engine to be used.
See [Selecting a Cache Engine and Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.html)
in the AWS Documentation center for supported versions

* `maintenance_window` – (Optional) Specifies the weekly time range for when maintenance
on the cache cluster is performed. The format is `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi` (24H Clock UTC).
The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period. Example: `sun:05:00-sun:09:00`

* `node_type` – (Required) The compute and memory capacity of the nodes. See
[Available Cache Node Types](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/details#Available_Cache_Node_Types) for
supported node types

* `num_cache_nodes` – (Required) The initial number of cache nodes that the
cache cluster will have. For Redis, this value must be 1. For Memcache, this
value must be between 1 and 20. If this number is reduced on subsequent runs,
the highest numbered nodes will be removed.

* `parameter_group_name` – (Required) Name of the parameter group to associate
with this cache cluster

* `port` – (Required) The port number on which each of the cache nodes will
accept connections. For Memcache the default is 11211, and for Redis the default port is 6379.

* `subnet_group_name` – (Optional, VPC only) Name of the subnet group to be used
for the cache cluster.

* `security_group_names` – (Optional, EC2 Classic only) List of security group
names to associate with this cache cluster

* `security_group_ids` – (Optional, VPC only) One or more VPC security groups associated
 with the cache cluster

* `apply_immediately` - (Optional) Specifies whether any database modifications
     are applied immediately, or during the next maintenance window. Default is
     `false`. See [Amazon ElastiCache Documentation for more information.][1]
     (Available since v0.6.0)

* `snapshot_arns` – (Optional) A single-element string list containing an
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Redis RDB snapshot file stored in Amazon S3.
Example: `arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/snapshot1.rdb`

* `snapshot_name` - (Optional) The name of a snapshot from which to restore data into the new node group.  Changing the `snapshot_name` forces a new resource.

* `snapshot_window` - (Optional, Redis only) The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache will
begin taking a daily snapshot of your cache cluster. Example: 05:00-09:00

* `snapshot_retention_limit` - (Optional, Redis only) The number of days for which ElastiCache will
retain automatic cache cluster snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set
SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, then a snapshot that was taken today will be retained for 5 days
before being deleted. If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0), backups are turned off.
Please note that setting a `snapshot_retention_limit` is not supported on cache.t1.micro or cache.t2.* cache nodes

* `notification_topic_arn` – (Optional) An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an
SNS topic to send ElastiCache notifications to. Example:
`arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:012345678999:my_sns_topic`

* `az_mode` - (Optional, Memcached only) Specifies whether the nodes in this Memcached node group are created in a single Availability Zone or created across multiple Availability Zones in the cluster's region. Valid values for this parameter are `single-az` or `cross-az`, default is `single-az`. If you want to choose `cross-az`, `num_cache_nodes` must be greater than `1`

* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The Availability Zone for the cache cluster. If you want to create cache nodes in multi-az, use `availability_zones`

* `availability_zones` - (Optional, Memcached only) List of Availability Zones in which the cache nodes will be created. If you want to create cache nodes in single-az, use `availability_zone`

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource

~> **NOTE:** Snapshotting functionality is not compatible with t2 instance types.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `cache_nodes` - List of node objects including `id`, `address`, `port` and `availability_zone`.
   Referenceable e.g. as `${aws_elasticache_cluster.bar.cache_nodes.0.address}`

* `configuration_endpoint` - (Memcached only) The configuration endpoint to allow host discovery.
* `cluster_address` - (Memcached only) The DNS name of the cache cluster without the port appended.

## Import

ElastiCache Clusters can be imported using the `cluster_id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_elasticache_cluster.my_cluster my_cluster
```
