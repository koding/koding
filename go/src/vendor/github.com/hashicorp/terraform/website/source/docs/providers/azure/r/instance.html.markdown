  ephemeral_contents = false
  description        = "Hosted service created by Terraform."
  label              = "tf-hs-01"
}

resource "azure_instance" "web" {
  name                 = "terraform-test"
  hosted_service_name  = "${azure_hosted_service.terraform-service.name}"
  image                = "Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS"
  size                 = "Basic_A1"
  storage_service_name = "yourstorage"
  location             = "West US"
  username             = "terraform"
  password             = "Pass!admin123"
  domain_name          = "contoso.com"
  domain_ou            = "OU=Servers,DC=contoso.com,DC=Contoso,DC=com"
  domain_username      = "Administrator"
  domain_password      = "Pa$$word123"

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the instance. Changing this forces a new
    resource to be created.

* `hosted_service_name` - (Optional) The name of the hosted service the
    instance should be deployed under. If not provided; it will default to the
    value of `name`. Changes to this parameter forces the creation of a new
    resource.

* `description` - (Optional) The description for the associated hosted service.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created (defaults to the instance
    name).

* `image` - (Required) The name of an existing VM or OS image to use for this
    instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `size` - (Required) The size of the instance.

* `subnet` - (Optional) The name of the subnet to connect this instance to. If
    a value is supplied `virtual_network` is required. Changing this forces a
    new resource to be created.

* `virtual_network` - (Optional) The name of the virtual network the `subnet`
    belongs to. If a value is supplied `subnet` is required. Changing this
    forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_service_name` - (Optional) The name of an existing storage account
    within the subscription which will be used to store the VHDs of this
    instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. **A Storage
    Service is required if you are using a Platform Image**

* `reverse_dns` - (Optional) The DNS address to which the IP address of the
    hosted service resolves when queried using a reverse DNS query. Changing
    this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the cloud service is
    created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `automatic_updates` - (Optional) If true this will enable automatic updates.
    This attribute is only used when creating a Windows instance. Changing this
    forces a new resource to be created (defaults false)

* `time_zone` - (Optional) The appropriate time zone for this instance in the
    format 'America/Los_Angeles'. This attribute is only used when creating a
    Windows instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created
    (defaults false)

* `username` - (Required) The username of a new user that will be created while
    creating the instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `password` - (Optional) The password of the new user that will be created
    while creating the instance. Required when creating a Windows instance or
    when not supplying an `ssh_key_thumbprint` while creating a Linux instance.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `ssh_key_thumbprint` - (Optional) The SSH thumbprint of an existing SSH key
    within the subscription. This attribute is only used when creating a Linux
    instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `security_group` - (Optional) The Network Security Group to associate with
