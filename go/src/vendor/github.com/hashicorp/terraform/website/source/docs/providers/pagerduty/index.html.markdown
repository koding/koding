# PagerDuty Provider

[PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) is an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams. It collects alerts from your monitoring tools, gives you an overall view of all of your monitoring alarms, and alerts an on duty engineer if thereâ€™s a problem.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the PagerDuty provider
provider "pagerduty" {
  token = "${var.pagerduty_token}"
}

# Create a PagerDuty team
resource "pagerduty_team" "engineering" {
  name        = "Engineering"
  description = "All engineering"
}

# Create a PagerDuty user
resource "pagerduty_user" "earline" {
  name  = "Earline Greenholt"
  email = "125.greenholt.earline@graham.name"
  teams = ["${pagerduty_team.engineering.id}"]
}
```
