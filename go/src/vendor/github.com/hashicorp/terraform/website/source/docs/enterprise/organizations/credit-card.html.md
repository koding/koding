# Add credit card details to an organization

To setup automated billing for your Terraform usage, you must add a credit card
to your organization's account. To do so, go into your account settings, then go
to the proper organization settings in the left navigation. Select billing in
the organization settings, and then enter your credit card information.

If you have any questions regarding billing or payment, contact [sales@hashicorp.com](mailto:sales@hashicorp.com).
