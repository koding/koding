## Organizations in Terraform Enterprise

Organizations are a group of users in Terraform Enterprise that have access and
ownership over shared resources. When operating within a team, we recommend
creating an organization to manage access control, auditing, billing and
authorization.

Each individual member of your organization should have their own account.
