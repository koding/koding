# Integration with Version Control Software

Terraform Enterprise can integrate with your version control software to
automatically execute Terraform with your latest Terraform configuration as you
commit changes to source control.

Different capabilities within Terraform Enterprise are available depending on
the integration in use. The available integration options are on the sidebar
navigation.
