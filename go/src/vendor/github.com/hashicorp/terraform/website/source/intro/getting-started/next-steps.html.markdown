# Next Steps

That concludes the getting started guide for Terraform. Hopefully
you're now able to not only see what Terraform is useful for, but
you're also able to put this knowledge to use to improve building
your own infrastructure.

We've covered the basics for all of these features in this guide.

As a next step, the following resources are available:

* [Documentation](/docs/index.html) - The documentation is an in-depth
  reference guide to all the features of Terraform, including
  technical details about the internals of how Terraform operates.

* [Examples](/intro/examples/index.html) - The examples have more full
  featured configuration files, showing some of the possibilities
  with Terraform.
