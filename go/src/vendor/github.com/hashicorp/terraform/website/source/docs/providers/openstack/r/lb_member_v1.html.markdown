# openstack\_lb\_member_v1

Manages a V1 load balancer member resource within OpenStack.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "openstack_lb_member_v1" "member_1" {
  pool_id = "d9415786-5f1a-428b-b35f-2f1523e146d2"
  address = "192.168.0.10"
  port    = 80
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Required) The region in which to obtain the V2 Networking client.
    A Networking client is needed to create an LB member. If omitted, the
    `OS_REGION_NAME` environment variable is used. Changing this creates a new
    LB member.

* `pool_id` - (Required)  The ID of the LB pool. Changing this creates a new
    member.

* `address` - (Required) The IP address of the member. Changing this creates a
    new member.

* `port` - (Required) An integer representing the port on which the member is
    hosted. Changing this creates a new member.

* `admin_state_up` - (Optional) The administrative state of the member.
    Acceptable values are 'true' and 'false'. Changing this value updates the
    state of the existing member.

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) The owner of the member. Required if admin wants to
    create a member for another tenant. Changing this creates a new member.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `region` - See Argument Reference above.
* `pool_id` - See Argument Reference above.
* `address` - See Argument Reference above.
* `port` - See Argument Reference above.
