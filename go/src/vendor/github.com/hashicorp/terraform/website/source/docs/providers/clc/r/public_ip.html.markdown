## Example Usage

```hcl
# Provision a public ip
resource "clc_public_ip" "backdoor" {
  server_id           = "${clc_server.node.0.id}"
  internal_ip_address = "${clc_server.node.0.private_ip_address}"

  ports {
    protocol = "ICMP"
    port     = -1
  }

  ports {
    protocol = "TCP"
    port     = 22
  }

  ports {
    protocol = "TCP"
    port     = 2000
    port_to  = 9000
  }

  source_restrictions {
    cidr = "85.39.22.15/30"
  }
}

output "ip" {
  value = "clc_public_ip.backdoor.id"
}
```

## Ports

`ports` is a block within the configuration that may be
repeated to specify open ports on the target IP. Each
`ports` block supports the following:

* `protocol` (Required, string) One of "tcp", "udp", "icmp".
* `port` (Required, int) The port to open. If defining a range, demarks starting port
* `portTo` (Optional, int) Given a port range, demarks the ending port.


<a id="source_restrictions"></a>
## SourceRestrictions

`source_restrictions` is a block within the configuration that may be
repeated to restrict ingress traffic on specified CIDR blocks. Each
`source_restrictions` block supports the following:

* `cidr` (Required, string) The IP or range of IPs in CIDR notation.
