# Count Example

[**Example Source Code**](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/examples/aws-count)

The `count` parameter on resources can simplify configurations
and let you scale resources by simply incrementing a number.

Additionally, variables can be used to expand a list of resources
for use elsewhere.

As with all the examples, just copy and paste the example and run
`terraform apply` to see it work.
