# Scaleway Provider

The Scaleway provider is used to manage Scaleway resources.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Here is an example that will setup the following:
+ An ARM Server.
+ An IP Address.
+ A security group.

(create this as sl.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):

```hcl
provider "scaleway" {
  organization = "<YOUR-ACCESS-KEY>"
 Â token        = "<YOUR-GENERATED-TOKEN>"
  region       = "par1"
}

resource "scaleway_ip" "ip" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_server" "test" {
  name  = "test"
  image = "aecaed73-51a5-4439-a127-6d8229847145"
  type  = "C2S"
}

resource "scaleway_volume" "test" {
  name       = "test"
  size_in_gb = 20
  type       = "l_ssd"
}

resource "scaleway_volume_attachment" "test" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
  volume = "${scaleway_volume.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group" "http" {
  name        = "http"
  description = "allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "http_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action    = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range  = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol  = "TCP"
  port      = 80
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "https_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action    = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range  = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol  = "TCP"
  port      = 443
}
```

You'll need to provide your Scaleway organization **access key** and **token**.

Your access key can be found on your Scaleway control panel, in the *Credentials* 
tab of the management panes. It is under the *Tokens* subsection, but is labelled 
seperately as **access key**.

Your **token** can be generated by selecting to "Create new token" under the same
subsection as above. This does not require further input, but giving each token a 
friendly-name is suggested.

If you do not want to put credentials in your configuration file,
you can leave them out:

```
provider "scaleway" {
  region       = "par1"
}
```

...and instead set these environment variables:

- **SCALEWAY_ORGANIZATION**: Your Scaleway `organization` access key
- **SCALEWAY_TOKEN**: Your API access `token`, generated by you
- **SCALEWAY_REGION**: The Scaleway region
