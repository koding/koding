  Terraform can store state remotely in Azure Storage.
---

# azure

**Kind: Standard (with no locking)**

Stores the state as a given key in a given bucket on [Microsoft Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/).

## Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azure" {
    storage_account_name = "abcd1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

Note that for the access credentials we recommend using a
[partial configuration](/docs/backends/config.html).

## Example Referencing

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "azure"
  config {
    storage_account_name = "terraform123abc"
    container_name       = "terraform-state"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```
