  max_size           = 2
  removal_policies   = ["OldestInstance", "NewestInstance"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `min_size` - (Required) Minimum number of ECS instances in the scaling group. Value range: [0, 100].
* `max_size` - (Required) Maximum number of ECS instances in the scaling group. Value range: [0, 100].
* `scaling_group_name` - (Optional) Name shown for the scaling group, which must contain 2-40 characters (English or Chinese). If this parameter is not specified, the default value is ScalingGroupId.
* `default_cooldown` - (Optional) Default cool-down time (in seconds) of the scaling group. Value range: [0, 86400]. The default value is 300s.
* `vswitch_id` - (Optional) The virtual switch ID which the ecs instance to be create in.
* `removal_policies` - (Optional) RemovalPolicy is used to select the ECS instances you want to remove from the scaling group when multiple candidates for removal exist. Optional values:
    - OldestInstance: removes the first ECS instance attached to the scaling group.
    - NewestInstance: removes the first ECS instance attached to the scaling group.
    - OldestScalingConfiguration: removes the ECS instance with the oldest scaling configuration.
    - Default values: OldestScalingConfiguration and OldestInstance. You can enter up to two removal policies.
* `db_instance_ids` - (Optional) If an RDS instance is specified in the scaling group, the scaling group automatically attaches the Intranet IP addresses of its ECS instances to the RDS access whitelist.
    - The specified RDS instance must be in running status.
    - The specified RDS instanceâ€™s whitelist must have room for more IP addresses.
* `loadbalancer_ids` - (Optional) If a Server Load Balancer instance is specified in the scaling group, the scaling group automatically attaches its ECS instances to the Server Load Balancer instance.
    - The Server Load Balancer instance must be enabled.
