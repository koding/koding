# Contacting Support

All users of Terraform Enterprise are urged to email feedback, questions or
requests to the HashiCorp team.

### Free Support

We do not currently publish support SLAs for free accounts, but endeavor to
respond as quickly as possible. We respond to most requests within less than 24
hours.

## HashiCorp Tools Support

It's often the case that Terraform Enterprise questions or feedback relates to
the HashiCorp tooling. We encourage all Terraform Enterprise users to search for
related issues and problems in the open source repositories and mailing lists
prior to contacting us to help make our support more efficient and to help
resolve problems faster.

Visit the updating tools section for a list of our tools and their project
websites.

## Documentation Feedback

Due to the dynamic nature of Terraform Enterprise and the broad set of features
it provides, there may be information lacking in the documentation.

In this case, we appreciate any feedback to be emailed to us so
we can make improvements. Please email feedback to
<a href="mailto:support@hashicorp.com">support@hashicorp.com</a>.
