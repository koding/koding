# ignition\_file

Describes a file to be written in a particular filesystem.

## Example Usage

File with inline content:

```hcl
data "ignition_file" "hello" {
	filesystem = "foo"
	path = "/hello.txt"
	content {
		content = "Hello World!"
	}
}
```

File with remote content:

```hcl
data "ignition_file" "hello" {
	filesystem = "qux"
	path = "/hello.txt"
	source {
		source = "http://example.com/hello.txt.gz"
		compression = "gzip"
		verification = "sha512-0123456789abcdef0123456789...456789abcdef"
	}
}
```
