```hcl
resource "cloudstack_loadbalancer_rule" "default" {
  name          = "loadbalancer-rule-1"
  description   = "Loadbalancer rule 1"
  ip_address_id = "30b21801-d4b3-4174-852b-0c0f30bdbbfb"
  algorithm     = "roundrobin"
  private_port  = 80
  public_port   = 80
  member_ids    = ["f8141e2f-4e7e-4c63-9362-986c908b7ea7"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the loadbalancer rule.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `description` - (Optional) The description of the load balancer rule.

* `ip_address_id` - (Required) Public IP address ID from where the network
    traffic will be load balanced from. Changing this forces a new resource
    to be created.

* `network_id` - (Optional) The network ID this rule will be created for.
    Required when public IP address is not associated with any network yet
    (VPC case).

* `algorithm` - (Required) Load balancer rule algorithm (source, roundrobin,
    leastconn). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_port` - (Required) The private port of the private IP address
    (virtual machine) where the network traffic will be load balanced to.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_port` - (Required) The public port from where the network traffic
    will be load balanced from. Changing this forces a new resource to be
    created.

* `member_ids` - (Required) List of instance IDs to assign to the load balancer
    rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `project` - (Optional) The name or ID of the project to deploy this
    instance to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The load balancer rule ID.
