// the wrong type. Some subtleties that the file system must care about:
//
//  *  If the new name is an existing directory, the file system must ensure it
//     is empty before replacing it, returning ENOTEMPTY otherwise. (This is
//     per the posix spec: http://goo.gl/4XtT79)
//
//  *  The rename must be atomic from the point of view of an observer of the
//     new name. That is, if the new name already exists, there must be no
//     point at which it doesn't exist.
//
//  *  It is okay for the new name to be modified before the old name is
//     removed; these need not be atomic. In fact, the Linux man page
//     explicitly says this is likely (cf. https://goo.gl/Y1wVZc).

//     it's not clear whether OS X does this, and in any case it doesn't matter

	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/rTQVSL) fuse_readdir, which implements iterate for fuse
	//     directories, passes dir_context::pos as the offset to fuse_read_fill,
	//     which passes it on to user-space. fuse_readdir later calls

	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/vU5ukv) For each returned result (except perhaps the
	//     last, which may be truncated by the page boundary), parse_dirfile
	//     updates dir_context::pos with fuse_dirent::off.

	//  *  (http://goo.gl/fQhbyn, http://goo.gl/ns1kDF) opendir initially causes
	//     filepos to be set to zero.
	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/ezNKyR, http://goo.gl/xOmDv0) readdir allows the user
	//     to iterate through the directory one entry at a time. As each entry is
	//     consumed, its d_off field is stored in __dirstream::filepos.
	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/WEOXG8, http://goo.gl/rjSXl3) telldir allows the user
	//     to obtain the d_off field from the most recently returned entry.
	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/WG3nDZ, http://goo.gl/Lp0U6W) seekdir allows the user
	//     to seek backward to an offset previously returned by telldir. It
	//     stores the new offset in filepos, and calls llseek to update the
	//     kernel's struct file.
	//
	//  *  (http://goo.gl/gONQhz, http://goo.gl/VlrQkc) rewinddir allows the user
	//     to go back to the beginning of the directory, obtaining a fresh view.
	//     It updates filepos and calls llseek to update the kernel's struct
	//     file.
	//
	// Unfortunately, FUSE offers no way to intercept seeks
	// (http://goo.gl/H6gEXa), so there is no way to cause seekdir or rewinddir
	// to fail. Additionally, there is no way to distinguish an explicit
	// rewinddir followed by readdir from the initial readdir, or a rewinddir
	// from a seekdir to the value returned by telldir just after opendir.
	//
	// Luckily, Posix is vague about what the user will see if they seek
	// backwards, and requires the user not to seek to an old offset after a
	// rewind. The only requirement on freshness is that rewinddir results in
	// something that looks like a newly-opened directory. So FUSE file systems

	// The offset at which to write the data below.
	//
	// The man page for pwrite(2) implies that aside from changing the file
	// handle's offset, using pwrite is equivalent to using lseek(2) and then
	// write(2). The man page for lseek(2) says the following:
	//
	// "The lseek() function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of
	// the file (but this does not change the size of the file). If data is later
	// written at this point, subsequent reads of the data in the gap (a "hole")
	// return null bytes (aq\0aq) until data is actually written into the gap."
	//
	// It is therefore reasonable to assume that the kernel is looking for
	// the following semantics:
	//
	// *   If the offset is less than or equal to the current size, extend the
	//     file as necessary to fit any data that goes past the end of the file.
	//
	// *   If the offset is greater than the current size, extend the file
	//     with null bytes until it is not, then do the above.
	//
	Offset int64

	// The data to write.
	//
	// The FUSE documentation requires that exactly the number of bytes supplied
	// be written, except on error (http://goo.gl/KUpwwn). This appears to be
	// because it uses file mmapping machinery (http://goo.gl/SGxnaN) to write a
	// page at a time.

// Synchronize the current contents of an open file to storage.

// vfs.txt documents this as being called for by the fsync(2) system call

//
//  *  (http://goo.gl/IQkWZa) sys_fsync calls do_fsync, calls vfs_fsync, calls
//     vfs_fsync_range.
//
//  *  (http://goo.gl/5L2SMy) vfs_fsync_range calls f_op->fsync.
//
// Note that this is also sent by fdatasync(2) (cf. http://goo.gl/01R7rF), and
// may be sent for msync(2) with the MS_SYNC flag (see the notes on
// FlushFileOp).
//
// See also: FlushFileOp, which may perform a similar function when closing a
// file (but which is not used in "real" file systems).
type SyncFileOp struct {
	// The file and handle being sync'd.

// Flush the current state of an open file to storage upon closing a file
// descriptor.
//
// vfs.txt documents this as being sent for each close(2) system call (cf.
// http://goo.gl/FSkbrq). Code walk for that case:
//
//  *  (http://goo.gl/e3lv0e) sys_close calls __close_fd, calls filp_close.
//  *  (http://goo.gl/nI8fxD) filp_close calls f_op->flush (fuse_flush).
//
// But note that this is also sent in other contexts where a file descriptor is
// closed, such as dup2(2) (cf. http://goo.gl/NQDvFS). In the case of close(2),
// a flush error is returned to the user. For dup2(2), it is not.
//
// One potentially significant case where this may not be sent is mmap'd files,
// where the behavior is complicated:
//
//  *  munmap(2) does not cause flushes (cf. http://goo.gl/j8B9g0).
//
//  *  On OS X, if a user modifies a mapped file via the mapping before
//     closing the file with close(2), the WriteFileOps for the modifications
//     may not be received before the FlushFileOp for the close(2) (cf.
//     http://goo.gl/kVmNcx).
//
//  *  However, even on OS X you can arrange for writes via a mapping to be
//     flushed by calling msync(2) followed by close(2). On OS X msync(2)
//     will cause a WriteFileOps to go through and close(2) will cause a
//     FlushFile as usual (cf. http://goo.gl/kVmNcx). On Linux, msync(2) does
//     nothing unless you set the MS_SYNC flag, in which case it causes a
//     SyncFileOp to be sent (cf. http://goo.gl/P3mErk).
//
// In summary: if you make data durable in both FlushFile and SyncFile, then
// your users can get safe behavior from mapped files on both operating systems
// by calling msync(2) with MS_SYNC, followed by munmap(2), followed by
// close(2). On Linux, the msync(2) is optional (cf. http://goo.gl/EIhAxv and
// the notes on WriteFileOp).
//
// Because of cases like dup2(2), FlushFileOps are not necessarily one to one
// with OpenFileOps. They should not be used for reference counting, and the
// handle must remain valid even after the flush op is received (use
// ReleaseFileHandleOp for disposing of it).
//
// Typical "real" file systems do not implement this, presumably relying on
// the kernel to write out the page cache to the block device eventually.
// They can get away with this because a later open(2) will see the same
// data. A file system that writes to remote storage however probably wants
// to at least schedule a real flush, and maybe do it immediately in order to
// return any errors that occur.
