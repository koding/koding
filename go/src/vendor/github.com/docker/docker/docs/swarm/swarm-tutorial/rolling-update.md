# Apply rolling updates to a service

In a previous step of the tutorial, you [scaled](scale-service.md) the number of
instances of a service. In this part of the tutorial, you deploy a service based
on the Redis 3.0.6 container image. Then you upgrade the service to use the
Redis 3.0.7 container image using rolling updates.

1. If you haven't already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you
run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named
`manager1`.

2. Deploy Redis 3.0.6 to the swarm and configure the swarm with a 10 second
update delay:

    ```bash
    $ docker service create \
      --replicas 3 \
      --name redis \
      --update-delay 10s \
      --update-parallelism 1 \
      redis:3.0.6

    0u6a4s31ybk7yw2wyvtikmu50
    ```

    You configure the rolling update policy at service deployment time.

    The `--update-parallelism` flag configures the number of service tasks that
    the scheduler can update simultaneously. When updates to individual tasks
    return a state of `RUNNING` or `FAILED`, the scheduler schedules another
    task to update until all tasks are updated.

    The `--update-delay` flag configures the time delay between updates to a
    service task or sets of tasks.

    You can describe the time `T` as a combination of the number of seconds
    `Ts`, minutes `Tm`, or hours `Th`. So `10m30s` indicates a 10 minute 30
    second delay.


3. Inspect the `redis` service:

    ```bash
    $ docker service inspect --pretty redis

    ID:             0u6a4s31ybk7yw2wyvtikmu50
    Name:           redis
    Mode:           Replicated
     Replicas:      3
    Placement:
     Strategy:	    Spread
    UpdateConfig:
     Parallelism:   1
     Delay:         10s
    ContainerSpec:
     Image:         redis:3.0.6
    Resources:
    ```

4. Now you can update the container image for `redis`. The swarm  manager
applies the update to nodes according to the `UpdateConfig` policy:

    ```bash
    $ docker service update --image redis:3.0.7 redis
    redis
    ```

    The scheduler applies rolling updates as follows:

    * Stop the initial number of tasks according to `--update-parallelism`.
    * Schedule updates for the stopped tasks.
    * Start the containers for the updated tasks.
    * After an update to a task completes, wait for the specified delay
    period before stopping the next task.

5. Run `docker service inspect --pretty redis` to see the new image in the
desired state:

    ```bash
    $ docker service inspect --pretty redis

    ID:             0u6a4s31ybk7yw2wyvtikmu50
    Name:           redis
    Mode:           Replicated
     Replicas:      3
    Placement:
     Strategy:	    Spread
    UpdateConfig:
     Parallelism:   1
     Delay:         10s
    ContainerSpec:
     Image:         redis:3.0.7
    Resources:
    ```

6. Run `docker service tasks <TASK-ID>` to watch the rolling update:

    ```bash
    $ docker service tasks redis

    ID                         NAME     SERVICE  IMAGE        LAST STATE              DESIRED STATE  NODE
    dos1zffgeofhagnve8w864fco  redis.1  redis    redis:3.0.7  Running 37 seconds      Running        worker1
    9l3i4j85517skba5o7tn5m8g0  redis.2  redis    redis:3.0.7  Running About a minute  Running        worker2
    egiuiqpzrdbxks3wxgn8qib1g  redis.3  redis    redis:3.0.7  Running 48 seconds      Running        worker1
    ```

    Before Swarm updates all of the tasks, you can see that some are running
    `redis:3.0.6` while others are running `redis:3.0.7`. The output above shows
    the state once the rolling updates are done.

Next, learn about how to [drain a node](drain-node.md) in the Swarm.
