# Delete the service running on the swarm

The remaining steps in the tutorial don't use the `helloworld` service, so now
you can delete the service from the swarm.

1. If you haven't already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you
run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named
`manager1`.

2. Run `docker service remove helloworld` to remove the `helloworld` service.

    ```
    $ docker service rm helloworld

    helloworld
    ```

3. Run `docker service inspect <SERVICE-ID>` to verify that the swarm manager
removed the service. The CLI returns a message that the service is not found:

    ```
    $ docker service inspect helloworld
    []
    Error: no such service or task: helloworld
    ```

## What's next?

In the next step of the tutorial, you set up a new service and apply a
[rolling update](rolling-update.md).
