# The Docker commands

This section contains reference information on using Docker's command line
client. Each command has a reference page along with samples. If you are
unfamiliar with the command line, you should start by reading about how to
[Use the Docker command line](cli.md).

You start the Docker daemon with the command line. How you start the daemon
affects your Docker containers. For that reason you should also make sure to
read the [`dockerd`](dockerd.md) reference page.

For a list of Docker commands see [Command line reference guide](index.md).
