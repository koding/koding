# BOOTGROUPS - What groups should start on bootup?
#	Comma separated list of groups.
#	Leading comma, trailing comma or embedded double
#	comma indicates when the NULL group should be run.
# Example (default): boot the onboot group first then the NULL group
env BOOTGROUPS="onboot,"

#	Container shutdown can result in lengthy system
#	shutdown times.  Even 5 seconds per container can be
#	too long.

# OPTIONS can be used for anything else.
#	If you want to boot everything then
#	options can be "-a" or "-a -A".

# STOPOPTS are stop options.  The can be used for anything else to stop.
#	If you want to kill containers fast, use -k
