To contribute, please submit a Pull Request. The only thing that we ask that you do 
is to certify that the contribution (code, docs, etc) was done by you. You can do this with 
a very simple step: include a line in your first pull request comment such as:

        â€œDCO 1.1 Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>"

By doing this one simple thing you are telling the community that you wrote the code you are contributing or have the right to pass on the code that you are contributing. The DCO 1.1 referenced is the Developer Certificate of Origin that is used in the Linux Kernel community, you can find it [here](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin "DCO 1.1").
