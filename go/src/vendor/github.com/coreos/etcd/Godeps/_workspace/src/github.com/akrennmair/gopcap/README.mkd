# PCAP

This is a simple wrapper around libpcap for Go.  Originally written by Andreas
Krennmair <ak@synflood.at> and only minorly touched up by Mark Smith <mark@qq.is>.

Please see the included pcaptest.go and tcpdump.go programs for instructions on
how to use this library.

Miek Gieben <miek@miek.nl> has created a more Go-like package and replaced functionality
with standard functions from the standard library. The package has also been renamed to
pcap.
