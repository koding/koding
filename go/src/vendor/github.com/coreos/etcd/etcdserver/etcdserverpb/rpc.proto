// From google paxosdb paper:
// Our implementation hinges around a powerful primitive which we call MultiOp. All other database
// operations except for iteration are implemented as a single call to MultiOp. A MultiOp is applied atomically
// and consists of three components:
// 1. A list of tests called guard. Each test in guard checks a single entry in the database. It may check
// for the absence or presence of a value, or compare with a given value. Two different tests in the guard
// may apply to the same or different entries in the database. All tests in the guard are applied and
// MultiOp returns the results. If all tests are true, MultiOp executes t op (see item 2 below), otherwise
// it executes f op (see item 3 below).
// 2. A list of database operations called t op. Each operation in the list is either an insert, delete, or
// lookup operation, and applies to a single database entry. Two different operations in the list may apply
// to the same or different entries in the database. These operations are executed
// if guard evaluates to
// true.
// 3. A list of database operations called f op. Like t op, but executed if guard evaluates to false.
