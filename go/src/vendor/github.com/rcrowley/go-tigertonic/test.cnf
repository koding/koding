# OpenSSL configuration for generating the self-signed test.crt for testing
# Tiger Tonic.  Here's how to use it:
#
#     openssl genrsa -out $@ 2048
#     openssl req -config test.cnf -days 3650 -key $< -new -out $@ -x509
#
# Then you can inspect the output, if you care:
#
#     openssl rsa -in test.key -noout -text
#     openssl x509 -in test.crt -noout -text
#
