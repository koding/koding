// Tiger Tonic [1] is a Go framework for building JSON web services inspired
// by Dropwizard [2].  If HTML is your game, this will hurt a little.
//
// Like the Go language itself, Tiger Tonic strives to keep features
// orthogonal.  It defers what it can to the Go standard library,
// go-metrics [3], and a few other packages.
