Pull Requests
-------------

Want to add a feature or fix a bug? If it's something small, just send a pull
request. If it's something big, please get in touch and ask if I'm interested
before working on it.

I'm pretty picky, so don't be alarmed if I ask you to change things or just say
I'm not interested. If you're offended, maybe
[a kitten](http://emergencykitten.com/) will help cheer you up?
