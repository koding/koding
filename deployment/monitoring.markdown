# [Koding Monitoring](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#alarm:alarmFilter=ANY)


Our monitoring and alerting system is handled by [Amazon CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1)

All of our <env_name>* has the same type of monitoring and notification system.

When a check turns to alarm state, AWS will send a very detailed notification email to sysops+<env_name>@koding.com.

Load Balancer:

```
// The number of errors encountered by the load balancer while attempting to
// connect to application.
//
// Threshold: BackendConnectionErrors >= 5 for 5 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_BackendConnectionErrors_Avg_5_For_1x5Min
```

```
// The count of the number of healthy instances in each Availability Zone. Hosts
// are declared healthy if they meet the threshold for the number of consecutive
// health checks that are successful. Hosts that have failed more health checks
// than the value of the unhealthy threshold are considered unhealthy. If cross-
// zone is enabled, the count of the number of healthy instances is calculated for
// all Availability Zones.
// Threshold: HealthyHostCount <= 0 for 1 minute
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_Healty_Hosts_Avg_0_For_1x1Min
```

```
// The count of the number of HTTP response codes generated by back-end instances.
// This metric does not include any response codes generated by the load balancer.
//
// Threshold: HTTPCode_ELB_5XX >= 10 for 5 minutes
// Threshold: HTTPCode_ELB_4XX >= 10 for 5 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_HTTPCode_Backend_5XX_Avg_10_For_1x5Min
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_HTTPCode_Backend_4XX_Avg_10_For_1x5Min
```

```
// Avarage latency while connecting to the app
//
// Threshold: Latency >= 0.01 for 15 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_Latency_Avg_0.01S_For_1x15Min
```

```
// The number of rejected requests due to a full surge queue.
//
// Threshold: SpilloverCount >= 20 for 5 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_SpilloverCount_Avg_20_For_1x5Min
```

```
// All requests that are proxied by ELB
//
// Threshold: RequestCount >= 10,000 for 15 minute
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_SumRequests_Avg_10000_For_1x15Min
```

```
// Surge Queue Length: the number of requests queued by the load balancer,
// awaiting a back-end instance to accept connections and process the request.
// Threshold: SurgeQueueLength >= 20 for 5 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_SurgeQueue_Avg_20_For_1x5Min
```

```
// The count of the number of unhealthy instances in each Availability Zone. Hosts
// that have failed more health checks than the value of the unhealthy threshold
// are considered unhealthy. If cross-zone is enabled, the count of the number of
// unhealthy instances is calculated for all Availability Zones.
//
// Instances may become unhealthy due to connectivity issues, health checks
// returning non-200 responses (in the case of HTTP or HTTPS health checks), or
// timeouts when performing the health check.
//
// Threshold: UnHealthyHostCount >= 1 for 15 minutes
<env_name>.koding.com_ELB_Unhealty_Hosts_Avg_1_For_1x15Min
