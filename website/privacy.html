      <span class='s1'>This Application collects some Personal Data from its
        Users. Koding, Inc. </span>(&ldquo;Koding&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;)
        is committed to protecting the privacy of your information. This Privacy
        Statement describes the Koding site and platform privacy practices.

    <p class='p4'>
      Koding operates the Koding service and related services, applications,
      domains and networks offered by Koding (&quot;Koding Service&quot;).
      Koding&rsquo;s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we
      collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help
      you make informed decisions when using the Koding Service. By using or
      accessing the Koding Service, you are accepting the practices described
      in this Privacy Policy.

    <p class='p4'>
      <b>Information Gathered by Koding</b>
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      For visitors to our website and registered users, we log standard technical
      information, such as your IP address. If you choose to register with us,
      Koding requires you to provide your name, email address, and each user has
      a user ID and password that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important
      not to share your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a
      mix of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others to
      guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a regular
      basis. In addition, Koding will require you to provide geographical information
      such as your physical address. In the future Koding may ask you to provide
      other demographic information, such as age, gender, interests or occupation,
      as well as credit card information for verification purposes. We may collect
      other personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or
      communicate with others through our systems. Koding also uses
      &quot;cookies&quot; &ndash; small files containing a string of characters
      sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser &ndash; in
      addition to Flash shared browser objects to administer its website and
      provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For example,
      we may use cookies or Flash objects to count the number of unique computers
      accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from the
      Koding Service if you choose. When you access the Koding Service or open one
      of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your
      system by using different types of tracking technology. This &quot;automatically
      collected&quot; information may include IP Address, a unique device or
      user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages
      that you access on the Koding Service, and the dates and times that you visit
      the Koding Service.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      <b>Koding Uses of Information</b>
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      The information we collect about you in the course of our relationship is
      used to provide the Koding Service to you. For example, as we endeavor to
      protect your identity, we may use your demographic information to create
      a database of user profiles, select advertisements based on your information
      and for marketing analysis. In addition, we look at technical information
      to diagnose problems with our systems, to administer the Koding Service,
      and to enhance the services we provide to you. We may use your information
      to track user-generated content and users to the extent necessary to comply
      as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We will
      use your email address, without further consent, for administrative
      communications such as notifying you of major updates, for customer service
      purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to
      contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded
      from the Koding Service service.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      Koding uses all of the information that we collect to understand the
      usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Koding
      Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.
      Koding may use &quot;automatically collected&quot; information, &quot;cookies&quot;,
      and Flash objects to: (a) automatically update the Koding Service service;
      (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during
      your visit or the next time you access the Koding Service; (c) monitor
      aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages
      accessed; and (d) track your entries, submissions, participation and status
      in any promotions or other activities, and usage of the Koding Service.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      <b>When Koding Discloses Information</b>
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      Koding does not share your personally identifiable information, including
      any of your user profile data that you create, with other organizations
      for their marketing or promotional uses. Please be aware, however, that 1)
      any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to
      display on the Koding Service becomes publicly available and may be collected
      and used by others without restriction; and 2) as a feature of the Koding
      Service, other users may become aware of your behavior or document viewing
      activities to their own profile pages and may use this information without
      restriction; provided that you will have the ability to opt out of this
      feature at anytime.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      Koding may share personally identifiable information about our users with
      third parties, including: (a) with your consent or as otherwise stated in
      this Privacy Policy; (b) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary
      pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order; (c) where
      required by law; or (d) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to
      respond to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public,
      or to protect the rights or property of the Koding Service or any third
      party. We may disclose personally identifiable information to affiliated
      companies, sub-contractors, other agents or businesses or persons to:
      provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill
      orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality;
      and assist Koding in improving the Koding Service and creating new service
      features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance
      with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such
      information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality
      measures to keep your information secure. Koding may also disclose to third
      parties anonymous aggregated user information that is not personally
      identifiable.
    </p>
    <p class='p4'>
      <b>Changing or Deleting Your Information</b>
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      You have the ability and control to remove or alter your account-specific
      information, including any user profile data that you provide to the Koding
      Service at any time. Access and control over most user-provided personal
      information on the Koding Service is readily available through the edit
      function on your profile. As a user of the Koding Service, you may modify
      or remove any of your profile information at any time by logging into your
      account. Information will be updated promptly. If you wish to deactivate
      your Koding Service account, you may do so. Removed information such as
      your user ID, geographical information connected to your user ID, and
      any computer files that you have uploaded to the Koding Service may
      persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time, and thus
      may continue to be publicly available across features of the Koding
      Service such as its search engine, but will not be generally accessible
      by Koding or users of the Koding service.

      <b>Data Security</b>
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      Koding will take appropriate security measures designed to protect against
      unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction
      of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and
      processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security
      measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store
      personal data. Koding processes personal information only for the purposes
      for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any
      applicable service-specific privacy notice. Koding takes reasonable steps
      to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete,
      and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal
      information whenever necessary.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      We endeavor to restrict access to personal information to Koding employees,
      contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate,
      develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
      obligations and are required to meet these obligations.
    </p>

    <p class='p4'>
      If Koding learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify
      you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
      Koding may post a notice on the Koding Service if a security breach occurs.
      Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice
      of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a
      security breach you should notify us at <span class='s3'>privacy@koding.com</span>.

      In the event that Koding is acquired by or merged with a third-party
      entity, or undergoes a change of control or any form of sale or transfer
      of some or all of its assets, we reserve the right, in any of these
      circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected
      from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of
      control.
