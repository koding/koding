      browsing the Koding Service, or for any user who creates a Koding account
      on or after that date.
    </p>

    <p class='p2'>
      <b>Eligibility and Assent to Terms:</b> The following Terms
      of Service are for the koding.com website, software applications made
      available by Koding from the website or via a third party ('Software'), and
      any application programming interface ('API') or other technology or
      services made available by Koding via the website or Software
      (collectively, the 'Koding Service') is a legal contract between you,
      ('You' or, collectively, 'Users'), and Koding regarding your use of the
      Koding Service ('Terms'). The Koding Service is not available to any users
      previously removed from the Koding Service by Koding. By accessing or using
      the Site in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing
      the Site or contributing content or other materials to the Site, you agree
      to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
    </p>

    <p class='p2'>
      These Terms provide that all disputes between you and Koding
      will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
      GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for
      matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be
      determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims
      cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the 'Arbitration
      Agreement' section below for the details regarding your agreement to
      arbitrate any disputes with Koding.
    </p>

    <p class='p2'>
      YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO
      BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY FUTURE MODIFICATIONS. IF AT ANY TIME
      YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PLEASE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR USE OF
      THE KODING SERVICE.
    </p>

    <p class='p2'>
      IF YOU ARE USING OR OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH KODING ON BEHALF
      OF A COMPANY, ENTITY, OR ORGANIZATION (COLLECTIVELY, A 'SUBSCRIBING
      ORGANIZATION') THEN YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AN AUTHORIZED
      REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO BIND
      SUCH ORGANIZATION TO THESE TERMS AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH
      SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION.
    </p>

        <b>Intellectual Property:</b> The Site and its original
        content, features and functionality are owned by Koding, Inc. and are
        protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and
        other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.
      </li>

      <li class='li2'>
        <b>Modification:</b> We reserve the right, at our
        discretion, to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time.

        changes to these Terms by a notice posted on www.koding.com, by e-mail,

        If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or
        obligations, you will be required to accept the change in order to
        continue to use the Service. Material changes are effective upon your
        acceptance of the modified Terms. Immaterial changes are effective upon

        arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these Terms
        in effect that the time the dispute arose.
      </li>

      <li class='li2'>
        <b>Additional Terms:</b> Your use of the Koding Service
        is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or
        guidelines applicable to the Koding Service or certain features of the
        Koding Service that we may post on or link to on the Koding Service (the
        'Additional Terms'), such as end-user license agreements for any
        downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to
        particular features or content on the Koding Service, subject to Section
        1. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into,
        and made a part of, these Terms.
      </li>

      <li class='li2'>

        <b>Fees and Payment:</b>

        <ul class='ul1'>
          <li class='li2'>
            <b>Paid Services.</b> Some portions of the Koding
            Service may have fees associated with them (each, a 'Paid Service').
            You will have the opportunity to review and accept the fees that you
            will be charged before using a Paid Service. We may change fees for
            any portion of the Koding Service at any time. Unless otherwise
            stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            <b>Free Trial.</b> Koding may make available a 30-day
            trial for a Paid Service without charge to you ('Free Trial'). You
            may be required to enter a Payment Method (defined below) in order to
            register for a Free Trial. The applicable Paid Service will
            automatically commence, and your Payment Method will be charged in
            accordance with Section 3(d), at the end of the Free Trial unless you
            log into your Koding account and cancel the Paid Service before the
            end of the Free Trial.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            You are solely responsible for paying all fees and
            applicable taxes associated with your Koding Service account in a
            timely manner with a valid payment method. By electing to purchase or
            otherwise use a Paid Service, you authorize Koding or its third party
            payment processors to charge the credit card or other payment method
            identified by you ('Payment Method'), which you represent and warrant
            that you are authorized to use, all applicable fees for that Paid
            Service, including all applicable taxes. For purchases of one-time
            Paid Services (i.e., not subscriptions), your Payment Method will be
            billed for that Paid Service on the date that you make the
            purchase.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            For purchases of subscriptions to Paid Services:

            <ul class='ul1'>
              <li class='li2'>
                Your '<b>Subscription Billing Date</b>' is the
                date when you purchase your first subscription to a Paid Service.
                For example, if you purchase your first subscription to a Paid
                Service on January 10th: (1) your Subscription Billing Date for
                your first monthly subscription and all other monthly
                subscriptions you purchase is the 10th of each month, (2) your
                Subscription Billing Date for your first annual subscription is
                January 10th of each year, and (3) your Subscription Billing Date
                for all subsequent purchases of annual subscriptions will be the
                next soonest 10th monthly calendar day after your date of
                purchase. Your Payment Method will be charged automatically on
                the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next
                month or year, as applicable.
              </li>

              <li class='li2'>
                For any subscription to a Paid Service that you
                purchase after your Subscription Billing Date is established,
                your Payment Method will first be charged a pro-rata amount of
                the subscription fee for the number of days between the purchase
                date and the applicable Subscription Billing Date. Your Payment
                Method will then be charged the full periodic subscription fee
                for the next month or year, as applicable, on each Subscription
                Billing Date thereafter (or on the last day of the calendar
                month, if the last day of the calendar month occurs before the
                Subscription Billing Date for that month).
              </li>
            </ul>

          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            For any subscription to a Paid Service, that
            subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your
            subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription
            before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period's
            (i.e., month’s or year’s) subscription fees to your Payment Method.
            We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the Payment Method you
            provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method
            if you change your account information).
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and
            related billing and payment information that you provide to Koding
            may be shared by Koding with companies who work on Koding’s behalf,
            such as payment processors or credit agencies, solely for the purpose
            of checking credit, effecting payment to Koding and servicing your
            account. The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen
            Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and
            the financial institution providing such Payment Method. For certain
            Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a
            foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and
            credit card issuers for details. If your Payment Method for any Paid
            Service fails or your account is past due, (i) you agree to pay all
            amounts due on your Koding account upon demand, (ii) Koding may
            collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes
            charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) Koding
            reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your access to one
            or more Koding Services or your account with Koding. Upon any such
            termination, you will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees
            and charges relating to your account and your use of the Koding
            Service before termination.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            Any fees charged to your account are non-refundable
            except as expressly stated in these Terms. You agree to submit any
            dispute regarding any charge to your account in writing to Koding
            within thirty (30) days of the charge, otherwise that dispute will be
            waived and the charge will be final and not subject to challenge.
            Refunds (if any) made pursuant to a dispute, are at the discretion of
            Koding.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes
            imposed on your use of the Koding Services, including sales, use, or
            value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to Koding
            the applicable receipts or certificates regarding such remittances as
            soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that Koding is
            obligated to collect such taxes, Koding will charge your Payment
            Method or otherwise add the applicable to your billing account.
          </li>

        <b>User Accounts:</b> You may browse the koding.com
        website without creating an account, subject to these Terms. In order to
        use the full features of the Koding Service, you must register for an
        account or log into the Koding Service using another third party platform
        that we support ('Integrated Service'). Your use of any account with an
        Integrated Service is subject to any terms, conditions, and policies,
        including privacy policies, of that Integrated Service. You are solely
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and
        password and for restricting access to your computer or device, and you
        agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your
        account or password. You agree that the information you provide to Koding
        on registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current,
        and complete. You also agree that you will ensure that this information
        is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times. If you have reason to
        believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a
        loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID,
        password, or any credit, debit or charge card number, if applicable),
        then you must immediately notify Koding. You are solely liable for the
        losses incurred by Koding or others due to any unauthorized use of your
        Koding Service account.

        <b>Arbitration Agreement; Governing Law:&nbsp;</b>

        <ul class='ul1'>
          <li class='li2'>
            <span class='s1'>Generally</span>. In the interest of
            resolving disputes between you and Koding in the most expedient and
            cost effective manner, you and Koding agree that any and all disputes
            arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding
            arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
            Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may
            allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to
            very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages
            and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate
            disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or
            relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based
            in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other
            legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or
            after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that,
            by entering into these Terms, you and Koding are each waiving the
            right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            <span class='s1'>Exceptions</span>. You and Koding
            agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude,
            or otherwise limit either of our rights to: (i) bring an individual
            action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement actions through
            applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are
            available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to
            file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property
            infringement claims.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            <span class='s1'>Arbitration</span>. Any arbitration
            between you and Koding will be governed by the Commercial Dispute
            Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
            Related Disputes (collectively, 'AAA Rules') of the American
            Arbitration Association ('AAA'), as modified by these Terms, and will
            be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
            available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
            1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Koding.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            <span class='s1'>Arbitration Notice; Process</span>.
            If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Koding, by
            certified mail or FedEx (signature required), a written notice of
            your claim addressed to: Legal Dept., Koding, 131 Lytton Ave, Palo
            Alto, CA 94301, USA. If Koding elects to seek arbitration, it will
            send a written notice to the email address you provided to Koding for
            your account. An arbitration notice, whether sent by you or by
            Koding, must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
            dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. You and
            Koding each agree to use good faith efforts to directly resolve any
            claim, but if we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim
            within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Koding may
            commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims
            court. During any arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
            made by Koding or you must not be disclosed to the arbitrator. You
            may download or copy a form notice and a form to initiate arbitration
            at www.adr.org. If our dispute is finally resolved through
            arbitration in your favor, Koding will pay you: (A) the amount
            awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B) the last written settlement
            amount offered by Koding in settlement of the dispute prior to the
            arbitrator’s award; or (C) $1,000, whichever is highest.
          </li>

          <li class='li2'>
            <span class='s1'>Fees</span>. If you commence
            arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Koding will reimburse you
            for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for greater
            than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided
            by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a
            location to be agreed upon in the city of your billing address
            provided to Koding as part of your account registration, or, if no
            city was provided, in the in AAA office nearest to you, but if the
            claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration
            will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
            the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone
            hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
            Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
            claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for
            an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees
            will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to
            reimburse Koding for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
            otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of
            the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will
            issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
            findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
            based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
            payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
            proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of
            the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

          <li class='li2'>
            <b>No Class Actions. YOU AND Koding AGREE THAT EACH

            CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and
            Koding agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
            one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
            representative or class proceeding.

          <li class='li2'>
            <b>Modifications</b>. If Koding makes any future
            change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the
            Koding's address for notice), you may reject the change by sending us
            written notice within 30 days of Koding’s notice to you of the
            change, in which case your account with Koding will be immediately
            terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
            prior to the amendments you reject will survive.

            of this arbitration agreement provision will be void and, in that
            case, you and Koding both agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and

            without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any
            lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and

            regarding changes to these Terms, by email, regular mail or postings
            on the Koding Service. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours
            after email is sent, unless Koding is notified that the email address
            is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a
            postal address, if provided by you through the Koding Service. In
            such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of
            mailing. Notice posted on the Koding Service is deemed given 30 days
            following the initial posting. The failure of Koding to exercise or
            enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of
            these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by
