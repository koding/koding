    <h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>

    <p class='p2'>
      Your use of Koding (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) is subject to the following
      Acceptable Use Policy. If you are found to be in violation of our policies
      at any time, as determined by Koding in its sole discretion, we may warn
      you or suspend or terminate your account. Please note that we may change
      our Acceptable Use Policy at any time, and pursuant to the Service Terms,
      it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with and adhere to the
