; Logging Options

; Defines what classes of security alerts are logged to the syslog daemon.
; Logging of errors of the class S_MEMORY are always logged to syslog, no
; matter what this configuration says, because a corrupted heap could mean that
; the other logging options will malfunction during the logging process.
;suhosin.log.syslog = 

; Defines the syslog facility that is used when ALERTs are logged to syslog.
;suhosin.log.syslog.facility = 

; Defines the syslog priority that is used when ALERTs are logged to syslog.
;suhosin.log.syslog.priority = 

; Defines what classes of security alerts are logged through the SAPI error log.
;suhosin.log.sapi = 

; Defines what classes of security alerts are logged through the external
; logging.
;suhosin.log.script = 

; Defines what classes of security alerts are logged through the defined PHP
; script.
;suhosin.log.phpscript = 0

; Defines the full path to a external logging script. The script is called with
; 2 parameters. The first one is the alert class in string notation and the
; second parameter is the log message. This can be used for example to mail
; failing MySQL queries to your email address, because on a production system
; these things should never happen.
;suhosin.log.script.name = 

; Defines the full path to a PHP logging script. The script is called with 2
; variables registered in the current scope: SUHOSIN_ERRORCLASS and
; SUHOSIN_ERROR. The first one is the alert class and the second variable is
; the log message. This can be used for example to mail attempted remote URL
; include attacks to your email address.
;suhosin.log.phpscript.name = 

; Undocumented
;suhosin.log.phpscript.is_safe = Off

; When the Hardening-Patch logs an error the log message also contains the IP
; of the attacker. Usually this IP is retrieved from the REMOTE_ADDR SAPI
; environment variable. With this switch it is possible to change this behavior
; to read the IP from the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. This is f.e. necessary
; when your PHP server runs behind a reverse proxy.
;suhosin.log.use-x-forwarded-for = Off

; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Executor Options

; Defines the maximum stack depth allowed by the executor before it stops the
; script. Without this function an endless recursion in a PHP script could
; crash the PHP executor or trigger the configured memory_limit. A value of
; "0" disables this feature.
;suhosin.executor.max_depth = 0

; Defines how many "../" an include filename needs to contain to be considered
; an attack and stopped. A value of "2" will block "../../etc/passwd", while a
; value of "3" will allow it. Most PHP applications should work flawlessly with
; values "4" or "5". A value of "0" disables this feature.

; Comma separated whitelist of URL schemes that are allowed to be included from

; blacklist will terminate the script and get logged.
;suhosin.executor.eval.blacklist = 

; eval() is a very dangerous statement and therefore you might want to disable
; it completely. Deactivating it will however break lots of scripts. Because
; every violation is logged, this allows finding all places where eval() is
; used.
;suhosin.executor.disable_eval = Off

; The /e modifier inside preg_replace() allows code execution. Often it is the
; cause for remote code execution exploits. It is wise to deactivate this
; feature and test where in the application it is used. The developer using the
; /e modifier should be made aware that he should use preg_replace_callback()
; instead.
;suhosin.executor.disable_emodifier = Off

; This flag reactivates symlink() when open_basedir is used, which is disabled

; Misc Options

; If you fear that Suhosin breaks your application, you can activate Suhosin's
; simulation mode with this flag. When Suhosin runs in simulation mode,
; violations are logged as usual, but nothing is blocked or removed from the
; request. (Transparent Encryptions are NOT deactivated in simulation mode.)
;suhosin.simulation = Off

; APC 3.0.12(p1/p2) uses reserved resources without requesting a resource slot
; first. It always uses resource slot 0. If Suhosin got this slot assigned APC
; will overwrite the information Suhosin stores in this slot. When this flag is
; set Suhosin will request 2 Slots and use the second one. This allows working
; correctly with these buggy APC versions.
;suhosin.apc_bug_workaround = Off

; When a SQL Query fails scripts often spit out a bunch of useful information
; for possible attackers. When this configuration directive is turned on, the
; script will silently terminate, after the problem has been logged. (This is
; not yet supported)
;suhosin.sql.bailout_on_error = Off

; This is an experimental feature for shared environments. With this
; configuration option it is possible to specify a prefix that is automatically
; prepended to the database username, whenever a database connection is made.
; (Unless the username starts with the prefix)
;suhosin.sql.user_prefix = 

; This is an experimental feature for shared environments. With this
; configuration option it is possible to specify a postfix that is
; automatically appended to the database username, whenever a database
; connection is made. (Unless the username end with the postfix)
;
; With this feature it is possible for shared hosters to disallow customers to
; connect with the usernames of other customers. This feature is experimental,
; because support for PDO and PostgreSQL are not yet implemented. 
;suhosin.sql.user_postfix = 

; This directive controls if multiple headers are allowed or not in a header()
; call. By default the Hardening-Patch forbids this. (HTTP headers spanning
; multiple lines are still allowed).
;suhosin.multiheader = Off

; This directive controls if the mail() header protection is activated or not
; and to what degree it is activated. The appended table lists the possible
; activation levels.
suhosin.mail.protect = 1

; As long scripts are not running within safe_mode they are free to change the
; memory_limit to whatever value they want. Suhosin changes this fact and
; disallows setting the memory_limit to a value greater than the one the script
; started with, when this option is left at 0. A value greater than 0 means
; that Suhosin will disallows scripts setting the memory_limit to a value above
; this configured hard limit. This is for example usefull if you want to run
; the script normaly with a limit of 16M but image processing scripts may raise
; it to 20M.

; Transparent Encryption Options

; Flag that decides if the transparent session encryption is activated or not.
;suhosin.session.encrypt = On

; Documentroot field.

; Number of octets (0-4) from the REMOTE_ADDR that the transparent session
; encryption key depends on. Keep in mind that this should not be used on sites
; that have visitors from big ISPs, because their IP address often changes

; or intranets. When used wisely this is a transparent protection against
; session hijacking/fixation. 
;suhosin.session.cryptraddr = 0

; Number of octets (0-4) from the REMOTE_ADDR that have to match to decrypt the
; session. The difference to suhosin.session.cryptaddr is, that the IP is not
