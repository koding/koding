Do you see '/home/rainforestqa99' label on top of a file list next to left sidebar? Do you see 'Terminal' tab on the bottom? Do you see 'rainforestqa99@rainforestqa99:~$' in that 'Terminal' tab? 

Save image from here: {{ random.image }} to your desktop, return to the incognito window and drag and drop image to the file list under '/home/rainforestqa99' label (like in the screencast: http://recordit.co/KRArrgJ8Gs)
