Do you see '/home/rainforestqa99' label on top of a file list next to left sidebar? Do you see 'Terminal' tab on the bottom? Do you see 'rainforestqa99@rainforestqa99:~$' in that 'Terminal' tab? 

Open a new tab and save the image from here: {{ random.image }} to your desktop, return to the incognito window and drag and drop the image you downloaded to the file list under '/home/rainforestqa99' label (like in the screencast: http://recordit.co/KRArrgJ8Gs)
Is it added to the end of file list?

Click on the area under 'Untitled.txt' on top, then double click on the '.profile' file from file list under '/home/rainforestqa99' label and reload the page
Do you see still see '.profile' on top and 'Terminal' on the bottom?

Return to the first browser
Do you see that the image you newly added (by drag&drop) is listed under the file list?
