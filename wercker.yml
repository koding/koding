# This file describes how to package klient.deb and uploads to a persistent
# storage Packaging is done if a push is made to `klientkite.development` or
# `klientkite.production` branches on `koding` repository.
#
# 1. If a push is made to either branches, a build number is created from the
# latest version number and incremented.
#
# 2. A Debian package (deb) is built with a version with a semantical versioning.
# Also a gzip file is created in the same directory.
#
# 3. These files are then uploaded to AWS S3 to `koding-klient` bucket in a
# directory called `development/$BUILDNO/{foo.0.1.0.gz,foo.0.1.0_amd64.deb}`
#
# For future readers who are humble like me to inspect these variables:
# KLIENT_CHANNEL: development/production
# S3_KLIENTKITE: koding-klient
box: koding/base@0.0.12
