Koding for Teams allow you to bring your entire team or class to the same development environment through the same elegant experience that you have come to expect from our team. We used the knowledge that we gained from building "Solo" to create a product that will revolutionize the way you and your team think about cloud-based development.

Key Benefits:

- Reduce setup time for new team members.
- Treat your infrastructure as code. Easy to manage and even easier to upgrade!
- Predefine the compute resources that your team should have.
- Most cloud-providers are supported so you can use your existing infrastructure.
- Learn more on our [blog][1]

### How does it work?

*Koding for Teams* allows you to create a **Stack** for your team; once a Stack is created, it can be replicated across your team's developmentenvironments with just a few clicks. A stack file is a YAML file that describes the complete development environment configuration which may include multiple VMs each of which may have different packages and applications installed. During the Stack setup, you can also set up a code pull from any of the famous code repository providers (like Github or Gitlab). Furthermore, *Koding for Teams* allows you to share VMs with your teammates; even more, the *Koding for Teams* interface allows for pair programming.

### Great, how do I start?

It is easy to start working on Koding for Teams:

1. **Sign Up** for a new Koding for Teams account
2. **Create a [Stack][2]**
3. **Invite your teammates**
4. **Start coding!**

That's it, your teammates will receive an invitation email to join your Koding for Teams unique portal *ex: yourteam.koding.com*. Once they log in, they will be able to create their VM environment using the **Stack** that you created. You &amp; your team will also be able to collaborate and [share your VMs][3] from within the Koding interface.
