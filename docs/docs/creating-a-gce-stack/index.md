## Introduction

This guide will help you build Google Compute Engine stack. [Google Cloud][1] offers many services, one of which is [Google Compute Engine][2] which delivers virtual machines running in Google's data centers and worldwide fiber network.

You can configure the number of VMs and applications installed on each VM instance. Along with configuring VM size and region.
Your new team members will be able to use your stack to build their VMs environment and start working from day one.

> You will need to have a Google Cloud account to be able to create VMs on Google Data Center. This will require you to provide your credit card information. You can sign up for a 60 day free trial and $300 in credit. Learn more about [Google Compute Engine pricing][3].
