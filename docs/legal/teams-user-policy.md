18. Quotas and Limits

The Service is intended for development purposes and is not a production platform. We operate on shared servers and so we will rapidly suspend accounts that generate sustained high levels of load or use provided resources in a way that deteriorates the experience for other users.

Koding reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts found in violation of these items with or without prior notice given and without liability.

In addition, Koding reserves the right to terminate unused VMs after a period of inactivity (Usually 45-60 days). Inactive accounts will be notified before any such action is taken.
