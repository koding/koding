## And announcing the Uber Smart City Prize

![Uber_Logo_Developers_][2]

On top of the $100,000 Grand Prize, we've now partnered with [Uber][3] to introduce an awesome new prize: **the Smart City Prize.** Uber wants you to build your idea of a more connected and transportation efficient city with their API.

## **Now what?**

* **If you haven't applied yet**...[Apply NOW][4]!
* **Read the [rules][5]**. Read 'em all cause we're going to be following them! Set yourself up for success, and you'll be one step closer to taking home the $100,000 Grand Prize.
* **Start brainstorming**. While participants are not allowed to begin building their projects before the Hackathon, brainstorming, mockups and wireframes are encouraged and recommended. What problem will you solve? How will you do it?
* **Get excited, & spread the word.** This is a record-breaking hackathon, and you are invited to join us and build something amazing.

## **Oh...and one more thing.**

We're gearing up for another BIG partner announcement next week. We can't tell you the details just yet, but this news will be the biggest partnership news the developer community has heard in a long time. Watch this space!
