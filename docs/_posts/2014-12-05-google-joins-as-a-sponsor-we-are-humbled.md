Koders,

We could not be more excited to bring you the news that Google is now (officially) <!--more--> a sponsor of the [Global Virtual Hackathon][1]! They are adding to the total prize money. When one of largest (and awesomest) company on the planet joins in on our cause, we will assume that we are doing something right! Thanks Google! [We ♥ you][2].

The hackathon starts in a few hours, here are some stats:

* over 60,000 applicants across 19,000+ teams
* well over a 1,500 different [cities][3]
* we doubled our accepted team number to 2,000 and all 2,000 slots are now taken
* over $35,000 in prizes
* ....and of course, the endless (and creative) [tweet stream][4].

The mood in the office today is appropriately demonstrated by this GIF.

We are so looking forward to the next 48 hours!
