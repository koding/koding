When we announced the [Koding Global Virtual Hackathon][6], we had no clue it would end up being such a roaring success. Amazing users [from all over the world ][7]participated and made the event a memorable one. We received requests from several of our participants and users that they would like to see how the numbers added up. We recently concluded the analysis of all the data we collected and are happy to share it with you as an infographic. This visualization shows the scale, the reach and the interest of our participants.

Enjoy and wishing you a Very Happy New Year!
