# This file designates test suites to test run sets to be executed in
# parallel.
#
# Data structure is an array of arrays.  An inner array defines a
# parallel set.
#
# Order of inner array is irrelevant because each set will be started
# at the very same time if a host test server is reserved per set.
#
# Keep total duration of parallel sets close to each other.  This is
# the only thing to consider while adding a test suite to a set or
# moving a test suite from one set to another.
#
# Total test run will take long as the longest set.  If a set is
# taking longer than set goal then a new set can be added to list.
#
# Amount of test suites added to a set is not an issue as long as
# duration of that set is not taking so long than others.
#
# Test suites in a set will be executed consecutively.
