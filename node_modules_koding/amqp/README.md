## Installation

    npm install amqp

## Synopsis

IMPORTANT: This module only works with node v0.4.0 and later.

An example of connecting to a server and listening on a queue.

```javascript
var amqp = require('amqp');

var connection = amqp.createConnection({ host: 'dev.rabbitmq.com' });

// Wait for connection to become established.
connection.on('ready', function () {
  // Use the default 'amq.topic' exchange
  connection.queue('my-queue', function(q){
      // Catch all messages
      q.bind('#');
    
      // Receive messages
      q.subscribe(function (message) {
        // Print messages to stdout
        console.log(message);
      });
  });
});
```

## Connection

`new amqp.Connection()` Instantiates a new connection. Use
`connection.connect()` to connect to a server.

`amqp.createConnection()` returns an instance of `amqp.Connection`, which contains
an instance of `net.Socket` at its `socket` property. All events and methods which work on
`net.Socket` can also be used on an `amqp.Connection` instance. (e.g., the
events `'connect'` and `'close'`.)

### Connection options and URL

`amqp.createConnection([options, [implOptions]])` takes two options
objects as parameters.  The first options object has these defaults:

    { host: 'localhost'
    , port: 5672
    , login: 'guest'
    , password: 'guest'
    , authMechanism: 'AMQPLAIN'
    , vhost: '/'
    , ssl: { enabled : false
           }
    }

An example `options` object for creating an SSL connection has these properties:

    { host: 'localhost'
    , port: 5671
    , login: 'guest'
    , password: 'guest'
    , authMechanism: 'AMQPLAIN'
    , vhost: '/'
    , ssl: { enabled : true
           , keyFile : '/path/to/key/file'
           , certFile : '/path/to/cert/file'
           , caFile : '/path/to/cacert/file'
           , rejectUnauthorized : true
           }
    }

The key, certificate, and certificate authority files must be in pem format.
If `port` is not specified, the default AMQPS port 5671 is used.
If `rejectUnauthorized` is not specified, it defaults to true.

Options can also be passed in a single URL of the form

    amqp[s]://[user:password@]hostname[:port][/vhost]

AMQPLAIN is assumed for the auth mechanism.

Note that the vhost must be URL-encoded and appear as the only segment
of the path, i.e., the only unencoded slash is that leading; leaving
the path entirely empty indicates that the vhost `/`, as
above, should be used (it could also be supplied as the path `/%2f`).

This URL is supplied as the field `url` in the options; for example

```javascript
var conn =
  amqp.createConnection({url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672"});

```


Options provided as individual fields will override values given in
the URL.


You can also specify additional client properties for your connection
by setting the `clientProperties` field on the `options` object.

    { clientProperties: { applicationName: 'myApplication'
                        }
    }

By default the following client properties are set

    { product: 'node-amqp'
    , platform: 'node-' + process.version
    , version: nodeAMQPVersion
    }


The second options are specific to the node AMQP implementation. It has
the default values:

    { defaultExchangeName: ''
    , reconnect: true
    , reconnectBackoffStrategy: 'linear'
    , reconnectExponentialLimit: 120000
    , reconnectBackoffTime: 1000
    }

The defaultExchangeName is the default exchange to which
connection.publish will publish. In the past, the default exchange was
`amq.topic`, which is not ideal.  To emulate this behaviour, one can
create a connection like:

```javascript
var conn =
  amqp.createConnection({url: "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672"},
                        {defaultExchangeName: "amq.topic"});
```

 If the `reconnect` option is true, then the driver will attempt to reconnect using the
 configured strategy *any time* the connection becomes unavailable.  If this is not
 appropriate for your application, set this option to false.

 If you would like this option, you can set parameters controlling how aggressively the
 reconnections will be attempted.  Valid strategies are "linear" and "exponential".

 Backoff times are in milliseconds.  Under the "linear" strategy, the driver will pause
 `reconnectBackoffTime` ms before the first attempt, and between each subsequent attempt.
 Under the "exponential" strategy, the driver will pause `reconnectBackoffTime` ms before
 the first attempt, and will double the previous pause between each subsequent attempt
 until a connection is reestablished.

After a connection is established the `'connect'` event is fired as it is
with any `net.Connection` instance. AMQP requires a 7-way handshake which
must be completed before any communication can begin. `net.Connection` does
the handshake automatically and emits the `'ready'` event when the handshaking
is complete.

For backward compatibility, two additional options are available. Older
versions of this library placed the routingKey and deliveryTag for incoming
messages into the JSON payload received. This module was changed to
leave inbound JSON payloads pristine.  Some applications may need the
old behaviour. If the key `routingKeyInPayload` is set to true in the
connection `options`, the messages resulting from a subscribe call will
include a 'routingKey' key in the JSON payload.  If the key
`deliveryTagInPayload` is set to true in the connection options, the
deliveryTag of the incoming message will be placed in the JSON payload.


### connection.publish(queueName, body, options, callback)

Publishes a message to the default exchange; if the defaultExchange is
left as `''`, this effectively publishes the message to the queue
named.

This method proxies to the default exchange's `publish` method and parameters are passed
through untouched.

### connection.end()

`amqp.Connection` is derived from `net.Stream` and has all the same methods.
So use `connection.end()` to terminate a connection gracefully.




## Queue

Events: A queue will call the callback given to the `connection.queue()`
method once it is usable. For example:

```javascript
var q = connection.queue('my-queue', function (queue) {
  console.log('Queue ' + queue.name + ' is open');
});
```


Declaring a queue with an empty name will make the server generate a
random name.

### connection.queue(name, options, openCallback)

Returns a reference to a queue. The options are

- `passive`: boolean, default false.
    If set, the server will not create the queue.  The client can use
    this to check whether a queue exists without modifying the server
    state.
- `durable`: boolean, default false.
    Durable queues remain active when a server restarts.
    Non-durable queues (transient queues) are purged if/when a
    server restarts.  Note that durable queues do not necessarily
    hold persistent messages, although it does not make sense to
    send persistent messages to a transient queue.
- `exclusive`: boolean, default false.
    Exclusive queues may only be consumed from by the current connection.
    Setting the 'exclusive' flag always implies 'autoDelete'.
- `autoDelete`: boolean, default true.
    If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have finished
    using it. Last consumer can be cancelled either explicitly or because
    its channel is closed. If there was no consumer ever on the queue, it
    won't be deleted.
- `noDeclare`: boolean, default false.
    If set, the queue will not be declared, this will allow a queue to be
    deleted if you don't know its previous options.
- `arguments`: a map of additional arguments to pass in when creating a queue.
- `closeChannelOnUnsubscribe` : a boolean when true the channel will close on 
    unsubscrube, default false.

### queue.subscribe([options,] listener)

An easy subscription command. It works like this

```javascript
q.subscribe(function (message, headers, deliveryInfo) {
  console.log('Got a message with routing key ' + deliveryInfo.routingKey);
});
    
```

It will automatically acknowledge receipt of each message.

There are several options available.  Setting the options argument to
`{ ack: true }` (which defaults to false) will make it so that the AMQP
server only delivers a single message at a time. When you want the next
message, call `q.shift()`. When `ack` is false then you will receive
messages as fast as they come in. 

You can also use the prefetchCount option to increase the window of how
many messages the server will send you before you need to ack (quality of service).
`{ ack: true, prefetchCount: 1 }` is the default and will only send you one
message before you ack. Setting prefetchCount to 0 will make that window unlimited.

The `routingKeyInPayload` and `deliveryKeyInPayload` options determine
if the reception process will inject the routingKey and deliveryKey,
respectively, into the JSON payload received.  These default to unset
thus adopting the parent connection's values (which default to false).
Setting these to true provide backward compatibility for older
applications.

The `exclusive` option will subscribe to the queue in exclusive mode. Only one
subscriber is allowed at a time, and subsequent attempts to subscribe to the
same queue will result in an exception. This option differs from the exclusive
option passed when creating in a queue in that the queue itself is not exclusive,
only the consumers. This means that long lived durable queues can be used
as exclusive queues.

This method will emit `'basicQosOk'` when ready.


### queue.subscribeRaw([options,] listener)

Subscribes to a queue. The `listener` argument should be a function which
receives a message. This is a low-level interface - the message that the
listener receives will be a stream of binary data. You probably want to use
`subscribe` instead. For now this low-level interface is left undocumented.
Look at the source code if you need to do this.

This method will emit `'basicConsumeOk'` when ready.

### queue.unsubscribe(consumerTag)

Unsubscribe from a queue, given the consumer tag. The consumer tag is
supplied to the *promise callback* of `Queue.subscribeRaw` or
`Queue.subscribe`:

```javascript
connection.queue('foo', function(queue) {
  var ctag;
  queue.subscribe(function(msg) {...})
    .addCallback(function(ok) { ctag = ok.consumerTag; });
  // ... and in some other callback
  queue.unsubscribe(ctag);
});
```

Note that `Queue.unsubscribe` will not requeue messages that have not
been acknowledged. You need to close the queue or connection for that
to happen. You may also receive messages after calling `unsubscribe`;
you will **not** receive messages from the queue after the unsubscribe
promise callback has been invoked, however.

### queue.shift([reject[, requeue]])

For use with `subscribe({ack: true}, fn)`. Acknowledges the last
message if no arguments are provided or if `reject` is false. If
`reject` is true then the message will be rejected and put back onto
the queue if `requeue` is true, otherwise it will be discarded.


### queue.bind([exchange,] routing)

This method binds a queue to an exchange.  Until a queue is
bound it will not receive any messages, unless they are sent through
the unnamed exchange (see `defaultExchangeName` above).

If the `exchange` argument is left out `'amq.topic'` will be used.

This method will emit `'queueBindOk'` when complete.


### queue.unbind([exchange,] routing)

This method unbinds a queue from an exchange.

If the exchange argument is left out `'amq.topic'` will be used.

Ths method will emit `'queueUnbindOk'` when complete.


### queue.bind_headers([exchange,] routing)

This method binds a queue to an exchange.  Until a queue is
bound it will not receive any messages.

This method is to be used on an "headers"-type exchange. The routing
argument must contain the routing keys and the `x-match` value (`all` or `any`).

If the `exchange` argument is left out `'amq.headers'` will be used.

### queue.destroy(options)

Delete the queue. Without options, the queue will be deleted even if it has
pending messages or attached consumers. If +options.ifUnused+ is true, then
the queue will only be deleted if there are no consumers. If
+options.ifEmpty+ is true, the queue will only be deleted if it has no
messages.




## Exchange

Events: An exchange will call the callback given to the `connection.exchange()`
method once it is usable. For example:

```javascript
var exc = connection.exchange('my-exchange', function (exchange) {
  console.log('Exchange ' + exchange.name + ' is open');
});
```

### exchange.on('open', callback)

The open event is emitted when the exchange is declared and ready to
be used. This interface is considered deprecated.


### connection.exchange()
### connection.exchange(name, options={}, openCallback)

An exchange can be created using `connection.exchange()`. The method returns
an `amqp.Exchange` object.

Without any arguments, this method returns the default exchange.
Otherwise a string, `name`, is given as the first argument and an `options`
object for the second. The options are

- `type`: the type of exchange `'direct'`, `'fanout'`, or `'topic'` (default).
- `passive`: boolean, default false.
    If set, the server will not create the exchange.  The client can use
    this to check whether an exchange exists without modifying the server
    state.
- `durable`: boolean, default false.
    If set when creating a new exchange, the exchange will be marked as
    durable.  Durable exchanges remain active when a server restarts.
    Non-durable exchanges (transient exchanges) are purged if/when a
    server restarts.
- `confirm`: boolean, default false.
    If set when connecting to a exchange the channel will send acks 
    for publishes. Published tasks will emit 'ack' when it is acked.
- `autoDelete`: boolean, default true.
    If set, the exchange is deleted when there are no longer queues
    bound to it.
- `noDeclare`: boolean, default false.
    If set, the exchange will not be declared, this will allow the exchange
    to be deleted if you dont know its previous options.
- `confirm`: boolean, default false.
    If set, the exchange will be in confirm mode, and you will get a 
    'ack'|'error' event emitted on a publish, or the callback on the publish
    will be called.

An exchange will emit the `'open'` event when it is finally declared.


### exchange.publish(routingKey, message, options, callback)

Publishes a message to the exchange. The `routingKey` argument is a string
which helps routing in `topic` and `direct` exchanges. The `message` can be
either a Buffer or Object. A Buffer is used for sending raw bytes; an Object
is converted to JSON.

`options` is an object with any of the following

- `mandatory`: boolean, default false.
    This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be
    routed to a queue.  If this flag is set, the server will return an
    unroutable message with a Return method.  If this flag is false, the
    server silently drops the message.
- `immediate`: boolean, default false.
    This flag tells the server how to react if the message cannot be
    routed to a queue consumer immediately.  If this flag is set, the
    server will return an undeliverable message with a Return method.
    If this flag is false, the server will queue the message, but with
    no guarantee that it will ever be consumed.
- `contentType`: default `'application/octet-stream'`
- `contentEncoding`: default null.
- `headers`: default `{}`. Arbitrary application-specific message headers.
- `deliveryMode`: Non-persistent (1) or persistent (2)
- `priority`: The message priority, 0 to 9.
- `correlationId`: default null. Application correlation identifier
- `replyTo`: Usually used to name a reply queue for a request message.
- `expiration`: default null. Message expiration specification
- `messageId`: default null. Application message identifier
- `timestamp`: default null. Message timestamp
- `type`: default null. Message type name
- `userId`: default null. Creating user id
- `appId`: default null. Creating application id

`callback` is a function that will get called if the exchange is in confirm mode,
the value sent will be true or false, this is the presense of a error so true, means
an error occurred and false, means the publish was successfull

### exchange.destroy(ifUnused = true)

Deletes an exchange.
If the optional boolean second argument is set, the server will only
delete the exchange if it has no queue bindings. If the exchange has queue
bindings the server does not delete it but raises a channel exception
instead.

### exchange.bind(srcExchange, routingKey [, callback])

Binds the exchange (destination) to the given source exchange (srcExchange). 
When one exchange is bound to another, the destination (or receiving) exchange 
will receive all messages published to the source exchange that match the 
given routingKey. 

This method will emit `'exchangeBindOk'` when complete.

Please note that Exchange to Exchange Bindings (E2E) are an extension to the 
AMQP spec introduced by RabbitMQ, and that by using this feature, you will be 
reliant on RabbitMQ's AMQP implementation. For more information on E2E 
Bindings with RabbitMQ see:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/e2e.html

### exchange.unbind(srcExchange, routingKey [, callback])

Unbinds the exchange (destination) from the given source exchange (srcExchange). 
This is the reverse of the exchange.bind method above, and will stop messages 
from srcExchange/routingKey from being sent to the destination exchange. 

This method will emit `'exchangeUnbindOk'` when complete.

### exchange.bind_headers(exchange, routing [, bindCallback])

This method is to be used on an "headers"-type exchange. The routing
argument must contain the routing keys and the `x-match` value (`all` or `any`).
